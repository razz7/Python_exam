      "Column Contents :  [\"members of the congress: in reporting to the congress the state of the union, i find it impossible to characterize it other than one of general peace and prosperity. in some quarters our diplomacy is vexed with difficult and as yet unsolved problems, but nowhere are we met with armed conflict. if some occupations and areas are not flourishing, in none does there remain any acute chronic depression. what the country requires is not so much new policies as a steady continuation of those which are already being crowned with such abundant success. it can not be too often repeated that in common with all the world we are engaged in liquidating the war. in the present short session no great amount of new legislation is possible, but in order to comprehend what is most desirable some survey of our general situation is necessary. a large amount of time is consumed in the passage of appropriation bills. if each congress in its opening session would make appropriations to continue for two years, very much time would be saved which could either be devoted to a consideration of the general needs of the country or would result in decreasing the work of legislation. economy our present state of prosperity has been greatly promoted by three important causes, one of which is economy, resulting in reduction and reform in national taxation. another is the elimination of many kinds of waste. the third is a general raising of the standards of efficiency. this combination has brought the perfectly astonishing result of a reduction in the index price of commodities and an increase in the index rate of wages. we have secured a lowering of the cost to produce and a raising of the ability to consume. prosperity resulting from these causes rests on the securest of all foundations. it gathers strength from its own progress. in promoting this progress the chief part which the national government plays lies in the field of economy. whatever doubts may have been entertained as to the necessity of this policy and the beneficial results which would accrue from it to all the people of the nation, its wisdom must now be considered thoroughly demonstrated. it may not have appeared to be a novel or perhaps brilliant conception, but it has turned out to be preeminently sound. it has not failed to work. it has surely brought results. it does not have to be excused as a temporary expedient adopted as the lesser evil to remedy some abuse, it is not. a palliative seeking to treat symptoms, but a major operation for the, eradication at the source of a large number of social diseases. nothing is easier than the expenditure of public money. it does not appear to belong to anybody. the temptation is overwhelming to bestow it on somebody. but the results of extravagance are ruinous. the property of the country, like the freedom of the country, belongs to the people of the country. they have not empowered their government to take a dollar of it except for a necessary public purpose. but if the constitution conferred such right, sound economics would forbid it. nothing is more, destructive of the progress of the nation than government extravagance. it means an increase in the burden of taxation, dissipation of the returns from enterprise, a decrease in the real value of wages, with ultimate stagnation and decay. the whole theory of our institutions is based on the liberty and independence of the individual. he is dependent on himself for support and therefore entitled to the rewards of his own industry. he is not to be deprived of what he earns that others may be benefited by what they do not earn. what lie saves through his private effort is not to be wasted by government extravagance. our national activities have become so vast that it is necessary to scrutinize each item of public expenditure if we are to apply the principle of economy. at the last session we made an immediate increase in the annual budget of more than $100,000,000 in benefits conferred on the veterans of three wars, public buildings, and river and harbor improvement. many projects are being broached requiring further large outlays. i am convinced that it would be greatly for the welfare of the country if we avoid at the present session all commitments except those of the most pressing nature. from a reduction of the debt and taxes will accrue a wider benefit to all the people of this country than from embarking on any new enterprise. when our war debt is decreased we shall have resources for expansion. until that is accomplished we should confine ourselves to expenditures of the most urgent necessity. the department of commerce has performed a most important function in making plans and securing support of all kinds of national enterprise for the elimination of waste. efficiency has been greatly promoted through good management and the constantly increasing cooperation of the wage earners throughout the whole realm of private business. it is my opinion that this whole development has been predicated on the foundation of a protective tariff. tax reduction as a result of economy of administration by the executive and of appropriation by the congress, the end of this fiscal year will leave a surplus in the treasury estimated at $383,000,000. unless otherwise ordered, such surplus is used for the retirement of the war debt. a bond which can be retired today for 100 cents will cost the, people 104 1/4 cents to retire a year from now. while i favor a speedy reduction of the debt as already required by law and in accordance with the promises made to the holders of our liberty bonds when they were issued, there is no reason why a balanced portion of surplus revenue should not be applied to a reduction of taxation. it can not be repeated too often that the enormous revenues of this nation could not be collected without becoming a charge on all the people whether or not they directly pay taxes. everyone who is paying or the bare necessities of fool and shelter and clothing, without considering the better things of life, is indirectly paying a national tax. the nearly 20,000,000 owners of securities, the additional scores of millions of holders of insurance policies and depositors in savings banks, are all paying a national tax. millions of individuals and corporations are making a direct contribution to the national treasury which runs from 11/2 to 25 per cent of their income, besides a number of special requirements, like automobile and admission taxes. whenever the state of the treasury will permit, i believe in a reduction of taxation. i think the taxpayers are entitled to it. but i am not advocating tax reduction merely for the benefit of the taxpayer; i am advocating it for the benefit of the country. if it appeared feasible, i should welcome permanent tax reduction at this time. the estimated surplus, however, for june 30, 1928, is not much larger than is required in a going business of nearly $4,000,000,000. we have had but a few months' experience under the present revenue act and shall need to know what is developed by the returns of income produced under it, which are not required t o be made until about the time this session terminates, and what the economic probabilities of the country are in the latter part of 1927, before we can reach any justifiable conclusion as to permanent tax reduction. moreover the present surplus results from many nonrecurrent items. meantime, it is possible to grant some real relief by a simple measure making reductions in the payments which accrue on the 15th of march and june, 1927. 1 am very strongly of the conviction that this is so much a purely business matter that it ought not to be dealt with in a partisan spirit. the congress has already set the notable example of treating tax problems without much reference to party, which might well be continued. what i desire to advocate most earnestly is relief for the country from unnecessary tax burdens. we can not secure that if we stop to engage in a partisan controversy. as i do not think any change in the special taxes, or tiny permanent reduction is practical, i therefore urge both parties of the house ways and means committee to agree on a bill granting the temporary relief which i have indicated. such a reduction would directly affect millions of taxpayers, release large sums for investment in new enterprise, stimulating industrial production and agricultural consumption, and indirectly benefiting every family in the whole country. these are my convictions stated with full knowledge that it is for the congress to decide whether they judge it best to make such a reduction or leave the surplus for the present year to be applied to retirement of the war debt. that also is eventually tax reduction. protective tariff it is estimated that customs receipts for the present fiscal year will exceed $615,000,000, the largest which were ever secured from that source. the value of our imports for the last fiscal year was $4,466,000,000, an increase of more than 71 per cent since the present tariff law went into effect. of these imports about 65 per cent, or, roughly, $2,900,000,000, came in free of duty, which means that the united states affords a duty-free market to other countries almost equal in value to the total imports of germany and greatly exceeding the total imports of france. we have admitted a greater volume of free imports than any other country except england. we are, therefore, levying duties on about $1,550,000,000 of imports. nearly half of this, or $700,000,000, is subject to duties for the protection of agriculture and have their origin in countries other than europe. they substantially increased the prices received by our farmers for their produce. about $300,000.000 more is represented by luxuries such as costly rugs, furs, precious stones, etc. this leaves only about $550,000,000 of our imports under a schedule of duties which is in general under consideration when there is discussion of lowering the tariff. while the duties on this small portion, representing only about 12 per cent of our imports, undoubtedly represent the difference between a fair degree of prosperity or marked depression to many of our industries and the difference between good pay and steady work or wide unemployment to many of our wage earners, it is impossible to conceive how other countries or our own importers could be greatly benefited if these duties are reduced. those who are starting an agitation for a reduction of tariff duties, partly at least for the benefit of those to whom money has been lent abroad, ought to know that there does not seem to be a very large field within the area of our imports in which probable reductions would be advantageous to foreign goods. those who wish to benefit foreign producers are much more likely to secure that result by continuing the present enormous purchasing power which comes from our prosperity that hall?' increased our imports over 71 per cent in four years than from any advantages that are likely to accrue from a general tariff reduction. agriculture the important place which agriculture holds in the economic and social life of the nation can not be overestimated. the national government is justified in putting forth every effort to make the open country a desirable place to live. no condition meets this requirement which fails to supply a fair return on labor expended and capital invested. while some localities and some particular crops furnish exceptions, in general agriculture is continuing to make progress in recovering from the depression of 1921 and 1922. animal products and food products are in a more encouraging position, while cotton, due to the high prices of past years supplemented by ideal weather conditions, has been stimulated to a point of temporary over production. acting on the request of the cotton growing interests, appointed a committee to assist in carrying out their plans. as it result of this cooperation sufficient funds have been pledged to finance the storage and carrying of 4,000,000 bales of cotton. whether those who own the cotton are willing to put a part of their stock into this plan depends on themselves. the federal government has cooperated in providing ample facilities. no method of meeting the situation would be adequate which does not contemplate a reduction of about one-third in the acreage for the coming year. the responsibility for making the plan effective lies with those who own and finance cotton and cotton lands. the department of agriculture estimates the net income of agriculture for the year 1920-21 at only $375,000,000; for 1924-25, $2,656,000,000; for 1925-26, $2,757,000,000. this increase has been brought about in part by the method already referred to, of federal tax reduction, the elimination of waste, and increased efficiency in industry. the wide gap that existed a few years ago between the index price of agricultural products and the index price of other products has been gradually closing up, though the recent depression in cotton has somewhat enlarged it. agriculture had on the whole been going higher while industry had been growing lower. industrial and commercial activities, being carried on for the most part by corporations, are taxed at a much higher rate than farming, which is carried on by individuals. this will inevitably make industrial commodity costs high while war taxation lasts. it is because of this circumstance that national tax reduction has a very large indirect benefit upon the farmer, though it can not relieve him from the very great burden of the local taxes which he pays directly. we have practically relieved the farmer of any federal income tax. there is agreement on all sides that some portions of our agricultural industry have lagged behind other industries in recovery from the war and that further improvement in methods of marketing of agricultural products is most desirable. there is belief also that the federal government can further contribute to these ends beyond the many helpful measures taken during the last five years through the different acts of congress for advancing the interests of the farmers. the packers and stockyards act, establishing of the intermediate credit banks for agricultural purposes, the purnell act for agricultural research, the capper-volstead cooperative marketing act, the cooperative marketing act of 1926, amendments to the warehousing act, the enlargement of the activities of the department of agriculture, enlargement of the scope of loans by the farm loan board, the tariff on agricultural products, the large federal expenditure in improvement of waterways and highways, the reduction of federal taxes, in all comprise a great series of governmental actions in the advancement of the special interest of agriculture. in determination of what further measures may be undertaken it seems to me there are certain pitfalls which must be avoided and our test in avoiding them should be to avoid disaster to the farmer himself. acting upon my recommendation, the congress has ordered the interstate commerce commission to investigate the freight-rate structure, directing that such changes shall be made in freight rates as will promote freedom of movement of agricultural products. railroad consolidation which i am advocating would also result in a situation where rates could be made more advantageous for farm produce, as has recently been done in the revision of rates on fertilizers in the south. additional benefit will accrue from the development of our inland waterways. the mississippi river system carries a commerce of over 50,000,000 tons at a saving of nearly $18,000,000 annually. the inland waterways corporation operates boats on 2,500 miles of navigable streams and through its relation with 165 railroads carries freight into and out of 45 states of the union. during the past six months it has handled over 1,000,000 bushels of grain monthly and by its lower freight rates has raised the price of such grain to the farmer probably 21/2 cents to 3 cents a bushel. the highway system on which the federal government expends about $85,000,000 a year is of vital importance to the rural regions. the advantages to be derived from a more comprehensive and less expensive system. of transportation for agriculture ought to be supplemented by provision for an adequate supply of fertilizer at a lower cost than it is at. present obtainable. this advantage we are attempting to secure by the proposed development at muscle shoals, and there are promising experiments being made in synthetic chemistry for the production of nitrates. a survey should be made of the relation of government grazing lands to the livestock industry. additional legislation is desirable more definitely to establish the place of grazing in the administration of the national forests, properly subordinated to their functions of producing timber and conserving the water supply. over 180,000,000 acres of grazing lands are still pastured as commons in the public domain with little or no regulation. this has made their use so uncertain that it has contributed greatly to the instability of the livestock industry. very little of this land is suited to settlement or private ownership. some plan ought to be adopted for its use in grazing, corresponding broadly to that already successfully applied to the national forests. the development of sound and strong cooperative associations is of fundamental importance to our agriculture. it is encouraging to note, therefore, that a vigorous and healthy growth in the cooperative movement is continuing. cooperative associations reporting to the department of agriculture at the end of 1925 had on their membership rolls a total of 2,700,000 producers. their total business in 1925 amounted to approximately $2,400,000,000, compared with $635,800,000 in 1915. legislative action to assist cooperative associations and supplement their efforts was passed at the last session of congress. important credit measures were also provided by congress in 1923 which have been of inestimable value to the cooperative associations. although the federal credit agencies have served agriculture well, i think it may be possible to broaden and strengthen the service of these institutions. attention is again directed to the surplus problem of agriculture by the present cotton situation. surpluses often affect prices of various farm commodities in a disastrous manner, and the problem urgently demand?, a solution. discussions both in and out of congress during the past few years have given us a better understanding of the subject, and it is my hope that out of the various proposals made the basis will be found for a sound and effective solution upon which agreement can be reached. in my opinion cooperative marketing associations will be important aids to the ultimate solution of the problem. it may well be, however, that additional measures will be needed to supplement their efforts. i believe all will agree that such measures should not conflict with the best interests of the cooperatives, but rather assist and strengthen them. in working out this problem to any sound conclusion it is necessary to avoid putting the government into the business of production or marketing or attempting to enact legislation for the purpose of price fixing. the farmer does not favor any attempted remedies that partake of these elements. he has a sincere and candid desire for assistance. if matched by an equally sincere and candid consideration of the different remedies proposed ' a sound measure of relief ought to result. it is unfortunate that no general agreement has been reached by the various agricultural interests upon any of the proposed remedies. out of the discussion of various proposals which can be had before the committees of agriculture some measure ought to be perfected which would be generally satisfactory. due to the emergency arising from a heavy tropical storm in southern florida, i authorized the secretary of agriculture to use certain funds in anticipation of legislation to enable the farmers in that region to plant their crops. the department will present a bill ratifying the loans which were made for this purpose. federal legislation has been adopted authorizing the cooperation of the government with states and private owners in the protection of forest lands from fire.this preventive measure is of such great importance that i have recommended for it an increased appropriation. another preventive measure of great economic and sanitary importance is the eradication of tuberculosis in cattle. active work is now in progress in one-fourth of the counties of the united states to secure this result. over 12,000,000 cattle have been under treatment, and the average degree of infection has fallen from 4.9 per cent to 2.8 per cent. he federal government is making substantial expenditures for this purpose. serious damage is threatened to the corn crop by the european corn borer. since 1917 it has spread from eastern new england westward into indiana and now covers about 100,000 square miles. it is one of the most formidable pests because it spreads rapidly and is exceedingly difficult of control. it has assumed a menace that is of national magnitude and warrants the federal government in extending its cooperation to the state and local agencies which are attempting to prevent its further spread and secure its eradication. the whole question of agriculture needs most careful consideration. in the past few years the government has given this subject more attention than any other and has held more consultations in relation to it than on any other subject. while the government is not to be blamed for failure to perform the impossible, the agricultural regions are entitled to know that they have its constant solicitude and sympathy. many of the farmers are burdened with debts and taxes which they are unable to carry. we are expending in this country many millions of dollars each year to increase farm production. we ought now to put more emphasis on the question of farm marketing. if a sound solution of a permanent nature can be found for this problem, the congress ought not to hesitate to adopt it. development of water resources in previous messages i have referred to the national importance of the proper development of our water resources. the great projects of extension of the mississippi system, the protection an development of the lower colorado river, are before congress, and i have previously commented upon them. i favor the necessary legislation to expedite these projects. engineering studies are being made for connecting the great lakes with the north atlantic either through an all-american canal or by way of the st. lawrence river. these reports will undoubtedly be before the congress during its present session. it is unnecessary to dwell upon the great importance of such a waterway not only to our mid-continental basin but to the commerce and development of practically the whole nation. our river and harbor improvement should be continued in accordance with the present policy. expenditure of this character is compatible with economy; it is in the nature of capital investment. work should proceed on the basic trunk lines if this work is to be a success. if the country will be content to be moderate and patient and permit improvements to be made where they will do the greatest general good, rather than insisting on expenditures at this time on secondary projects, our internal waterways can be made a success. if proposes legislation results in a gross manifestation of local jealousies and selfishness, this program can not be carried out. ultimately we can take care of extensions, but our first effort should be confined to the main arteries. our inland commerce has been put to great inconvenience and expense by reason of the lowering of the water level of the great lakes. this is an international problem on which competent engineers are making reports. out of their study it is expected that a feasible method will be developed for raising the level to provide relief for our commerce and supply water for drainage. whenever a practical plan is presented it ought to be speedily adopted. reclamation it is increasingly evident that the federal government must in the future take a leading part in the impounding of water for conservation with incidental power for the development of the irrigable lands of the and region. the unused waters of the west are found mainly in large rivers. works to store and distribute these have such magnitude and cost that they are not attractive to private enterprise. water is the irreplaceable natural resource. its precipitation can not be increased. its storage on the higher reaches of streams, to meet growing needs, to be used repeatedly as it flows toward the seas, is a practical and prudent business policy. the united states promises to follow the course of older irrigation countries, where recent important irrigation developments have been carried out as national undertakings. it is gratifying, therefore, that conditions on federal reclamation projects have become satisfactory. the gross value of crop,, grown with water from project works increased from $110,000,000 in 1924 to $131,000,000 in 1925. the adjustments made last year by congress relieved irrigators from paying construction costs on unprofitable land, and by so doing inspired new hope and confidence in ability to meet the payments required. construction payments by water users last year were the largest in the history of the bureau. the anticipated reclamation fund will be fully absorbed for a number of years in the completion of old projects and the construction of projects inaugurated in the past three years. we should, however, continue to investigate and study the possibilities of a carefully planned development of promising projects, logically of governmental concern because of their physical magnitude, immense cost, and the interstate and international problems involved. only in this way may we be fully prepared to meet intelligently the needs of our fast-growing population in the years to come. transportation it would be difficult to conceive of any modern activity which contributes more to the necessities and conveniences of life than transportation. without it our present agricultural production and practically all of our commerce would ?be completely prostrated. one of the large contributing causes to the present highly satisfactory state of our economic condition is the prompt and dependable service, surpassing all our previous records, rendered by the railroads. this power has been fostered by the spirit of cooperation between federal and state regulatory commissions. to render this service more efficient and effective and to promote a more scientific regulation, the process of valuing railroad properties should be simplified and the primary valuations should be completed as rapidly as possible. the problem of rate reduction would be much simplified by a process of railroad consolidations. this principle has already been adopted as federal law. experience has shown that a more effective method must be provided. studies have already been made and legislation introduced seeking to promote this end. it would be of great advantage if it could be taken up at once and speedily enacted. the railroad systems of the country and the convenience of all the people are waiting on this important decision. merchant marine it is axiomatic that no agricultural and industrial country can get the full benefit of its own advantages without a merchant marine. we have been proceeding under the act of congress that contemplates the establishment of trade routes to be ultimately transferred to private ownership and operation. due to temporary conditions abroad and at home we have a large demand just now for certain types of freight vessels. some suggestion has been made for new construction. i do not feel that we are yet warranted in entering, that field. such ships as we might build could not be sold after they are launched for anywhere near what they would cost. we have expended over $250,000,000 out of the public treasury in recent years to make up the losses of operation, not counting the depreciation or any cost whatever of our capital investment. the great need of our merchant marine is not for more ships but for more freight. our merchants are altogether too indifferent about using american ships for the transportation of goods which they send abroad or bring home. some of our vessels necessarily need repairs, which should be made. i do not believe that the operation of our fleet is as economical and efficient as it could be made if placed under a single responsible head, leaving the shipping board free to deal with general matters of policy and regulation. radio legislation the department of commerce has for some years urgently presented the necessity for further legislation in order to protect radio listeners from interference between broadcasting stations and to carry out other regulatory functions. both branches of congress at the last session passed enactments intended to effect such regulation, but the two bills yet remain to be brought into agreement and final passage. due to decisions of the courts, the authority of the department under the law of 1912 has broken down; many more stations have been operating than can be accommodated within the limited number of wave lengths available; further stations are in course of construction; many stations have departed from the scheme of allocation set down by the department, and the whole service of this most important public function has drifted into such chaos as seems likely, if not remedied, to destroy its great value. i most urgently recommend that this legislation should be speedily enacted. i do not believe it is desirable to set tip further independent agencies in the government. rather i believe it advisable to entrust the important functions of deciding who shall exercise the privilege of radio transmission and under what conditions, the assigning of wave lengths and determination of power, to a board to be assembled whenever action on such questions becomes necessary. there should be right of appeal to the courts from the decisions of such board. the administration of the decisions of the board and the other features of regulation and promotion of radio in the public interest, together with scientific research, should remain in the department of commerce. such an arrangement makes for more expert, more efficient, and more economical administration that an independent agency or board, whose duties, after initial stages, require but little attention, in which administrative functions are confused with semijudicial functions and from which of necessity there must be greatly increased personnel and expenditure. the wage earner the great body of our people are made up of wage earners. several hundred thousands of them are on the pay rolls of the united states government. their condition very largely is fixed by legislation. we have recently provided increases in compensation under a method of reclassification and given them the advantage of a liberal retirement system as a support for their declining years. most of them are under the merit system, which is a guaranty of their intelligence, and the efficiency of their service is a demonstration of their loyalty. the federal government should continue to set a good example for all other employers. in the industries the condition of the wage earner has steadily improved. the 12-hour day is almost entirely unknown. skilled labor is well compensated. but there are unfortunately a multitude of workers who have not yet come to share in the general prosperity of the nation. both the public authorities and private enterprise should be solicitous to advance the welfare of this class. the federal government has been seeking to secure this end through a protective tariff, through restrictive immigration, through requiring safety devices for the prevention of accidents, through the granting of workman's compensation, through civilian vocational rehabilitation and education, through employment information bureaus, and through such humanitarian relief as was provided in the maternity and infancy legislation. it is a satisfaction to report that a more general condition of contentment exists among wage earners and the country is more free from labor disputes than it has been for years. while restrictive immigration has been adopted in part for the benefit of the wage earner, and in its entirety for the benefit of the country, it ought not to cause a needless separation of families and dependents from their natural source of support contrary to the dictates of humanity. bituminous coal no progress appears to have been made within large areas of the bituminous coal industry toward creation of voluntary machinery by which greater assurance can be given to the public of peaceful adjustment of wage difficulties such as has been accomplished in the anthracite industry. this bituminous industry is one of primary necessity and bears a great responsibility to the nation for continuity of supplies. as the wage agreements in the unionized section of the industry expire on april 1 next, and as conflicts may result which may imperil public interest, and have for many years often called for action of the executive in protection of the public, i again recommend the passage of such legislation as will assist the executive in dealing with such emergencies through a special temporary board of conciliation and mediation and through administrative agencies for the purpose of distribution of coal and protection of the consumers of coal from profiteering. at present the executive is not only without authority to act but is actually prohibited by law from making any expenditure to meet the emergency of a coal famine. judiciary the federal courts hold a high position in the administration of justice in the world. while individual judicial officers have sometimes been subjected to just criticism, the courts as a whole have maintained an exceedingly high standard. the congress may well consider the question of supplying fair salaries and conferring upon the supreme court the same rule-making power on the law side of the district courts that they have always possessed on the equity side. a bill is also pending providing for retirement after a certain number of years of service, although they have not been consecutive, which should have your favorable consideration. these faithful servants of the government are about the last that remain to be provided for in the postwar readjustments. banking there has been pending in congress for nearly three years banking legislation to clarify the national bank act and reasonably to increase the powers of the national banks. i believe that within the limitation of sound banking principles congress should now and for the future place the national banks upon a fair equality with their competitors, the state banks, and i trust that means may be found so that the differences on branch-banking legislation between the senate and the house of representatives may be settled along sound lines and the legislation promptly enacted. it would be difficult to overestimate the service which the federal reserve system has already rendered to the country. it is necessary only to recall the chaotic condition of our banking organization at the time the federal reserve system was put into operation. the old system consisted of a vast number of independent banking units, with scattered bank reserves which never could be mobilized in times of greatest need. in spite of vast banking resources, there was no coordination of reserves or any credit elasticity. as a consequence, a strain was felt even during crop-moving periods and when it was necessary to meet other seasonal and regularly recurring needs. the federal reserve system is not a panacea for all economic or financial ills. it can not prevent depression in certain industries which are experiencing overexpansion of production or contraction of their markets. its business is to furnish adequate credit and currency facilities. this it has succeeded in doing, both during the war and in the more difficult period of deflation and readjustment which followed. it enables us to look to the future with confidence and to make plans far ahead, based on the belief that the federal reserve system will exercise a steadying influence on credit conditions and thereby prevent tiny sudden or severe reactions from the period of prosperity which we are now enjoying. in order that these plans may go forward, action should be taken at the present session on the question of renewing the banks' charters and thereby insuring a continuation of the policies and present usefulness of the federal reserve system. federal regulation i am in favor of reducing, rather than expanding, government bureaus which seek to regulate and control the business activities of the people. everyone is aware that abuses exist and will exist so long as we are limited by human imperfections. unfortunately, human nature can not be changed by an act of the legislature. when practically the sole remedy for many evils lies in the necessity of the people looking out for themselves and reforming their own abuses, they will find that they are relying on a false security if the government assumes to hold out the promise that it is looking out for them and providing reforms for them. this principle is preeminently applicable to the national government. it is too much assumed that because an abuse exists it is the business of the national government to provide a remedy. the presumption should be that it is the business of local and state governments. such national action results in encroaching upon the salutary independence of the states and by undertaking to supersede their natural authority fills the land with bureaus and departments which are undertaking to do what it is impossible for them to accomplish and brings our whole system of government into disrespect and disfavor. we ought to maintain high standards. we ought to punish wrongdoing. society has not only the privilege but the absolute duty of protecting itself and its individuals. but we can not accomplish this end by adopting a wrong method. permanent success lies in local, rather than national action. unless the locality rises to its own requirements, there is an almost irresistible impulse for the national government to intervene. the states and the nation should both realize that such action is to be adopted only as a last resort. the negro the social well-being of our country requires our constant effort for the amelioration of race prejudice and the extension to all elements of equal opportunity and equal protection under the laws which are guaranteed by the. constitution. the federal government especially is charged with this obligation in behalf of the colored people of the nation. not only their remarkable progress, their devotion and their loyalty, but, our duty to ourselves under our claim that we are an enlightened people requires us to use all our power to protect them from the crime of lynching. although violence of this kind has very much decreased, while any of it remains we can not justify neglecting to make every effort to eradicate it by law. the education of the colored race under government encouragement is proceeding successfully and ought to have continuing support. an increasing need exists for properly educated and trained medical skill to be devoted to the service of this race. insular possessions this government holds in sacred trusteeship islands which it has acquired in the east and west indies. in all of them the people are more prosperous than at any previous time. a system of good roads, education, and general development is in progress. the people are better governed than ever before and generally content. in the philippine islands maj. gen. leonard wood has been governor general for five years and has administered his office with tact and ability greatly to the success of the filipino people. these are a proud and sensitive race, who are making such progress with our cooperation that we can view the results of this experiment with great satisfaction. as we are attempting to assist this race toward self-government, we should look upon their wishes with great respect, granting their requests immediately when they are right, yet maintaining a frank firmness in refusing when they are wrong. we shall measure their progress in no small part by their acceptance of the terms of the organic law under which the islands are governed and their faithful observance of its provisions. need exists for clarifying the duties of the auditor and declaring them to be what everyone had supposed they were. we have placed our own expenditures under the supervision of the comptroller general. it is not likely that the expenditures in the philippine islands need less supervision than our own. the governor general is hampered in his selection of subordinates by the necessity of securing a confirmation, which has oftentimes driven him to the expediency of using army officers in work for which civilian experts would be much better fitted. means should be provided for this and such other purposes as he may require out of the revenue which this government now turns back to the philippine treasury. in order that these possessions might stiffer no seeming neglect, i have recently sent col. carmi a thompson to the islands to make a survey in cooperation with the governor general to suggest what might be done to improve conditions. later, i may make a more extended report including recommendations. the economic development of the islands is very important. they ought not to be turned back to the people until they are both politically fitted for self-government and economically independent. large areas are adaptable to the production of rubber. no one contemplates any time in the future either under the present or a more independent form of government when we should not assume some responsibility for their defense. for their economic advantage, for the employment of their people, and as a contribution to our power of defense which could not be carried on without rubber, i believe this industry should be encouraged. it is especially adapted to the filipino people themselves, who might cultivate it individually on a small acreage. it could be carried on extensively by american capital in a way to furnish employment at good wages. i am opposed to the promotion of any policy that does not provide for absolute freedom on the part of the wage earners and do not think we should undertake to give power for large holdings of land in the islands against the opposition of the people of the locality. any development of the islands must be solely with the first object of benefiting the people of the islands. at an early day, these possessions should be taken out from under all military control and administered entirely on the civil side of government. national defense our policy of national defense is not one of making war, but of insuring peace. the land and sea force of america, both in its domestic and foreign implications, is distinctly a peace force. it is an arm of the police power to guarantee order and the execution of the law at home and security to our citizens abroad. no self-respecting nation would neglect to provide an army and navy proportionate to its population, the extent of its territory, and the dignity of the place which it occupies in the world. when it is considered that no navy in the world, with one exception, approaches ours and none surpasses it, that our regular army of about 115,000 men is the equal of any other like number of troops, that our entire permanent and reserve land and sea force trained and training consists of a personnel of about 610,000, and that our annual appropriations are about $680,000,000 a year, expended under the direction of an exceedingly competent staff, it can not be said that our country is neglecting its national defense. it is true that a cult of disparagement exists, but that candid examination made by the congress through its various committees has always reassured the country and demonstrated that it is maintaining the most adequate defensive forces in these present years that it has ever supported in time of peace. this general policy should be kept in effect. here and there temporary changes may be made in personnel to meet requirements in other directions. attention should be given to submarines, cruisers, and air forces. particular points may need strengthening, but as a whole our military power is sufficient. the one weak place in the whole line is our still stupendous war debt. in any modern campaign the dollars are the shock troops. with a depleted treasury in the rear, no army can maintain itself in the field. a country loaded with debt is a country devoid of the first line of defense. economy is the handmaid of preparedness. if we wish to be able to defend ourselves to the full extent of our power in the future, we shall discharge as soon as possible the financial burden of the last war. otherwise we would face a crisis with a part of our capital resources already expended. the amount and kind of our military equipment is preeminently a question for the decision of the congress, after giving due consideration to the advice of military experts and the available public revenue. nothing is more laudable than the cooperation of the agricultural and industrial resources of the country for the purpose of supplying the needs of national defense. in time of peril the people employed in these interests volunteered in a most self-sacrificing way, often at the nominal charge of a dollar a year. but the army and navy are not supported for the benefit of supply concerns; supply concerns are supported for the benefit of the army and navy. the distribution of orders on what is needed from different concerns for the purpose of keeping up equipment and organization is perfectly justified, but any attempt to prevail upon the government to purchase beyond its needs ought not to be tolerated. it is eminently fair that those who deal with the government should do so at a reasonable profit. however, public money is expended not that some one may profit by it, but in order to serve a public purpose. while our policy of national defense will proceed in order that we may be independent and self-sufficient, i am opposed to engaging in any attempt at competitive armaments. no matter how much or how little some other country may feel constrained to provide, we can well afford to set the example, not of being dictated to by others, but of adopting our own standards. we are strong enough to pursue that method, which will be a most wholesome model for the rest of the world. we are eminently peaceful, but we are by no means weak. while we submit our differences with others, not to the adjudication of force, but of reason, it is not because we are unable to defend our rights. while we are doing our best to eliminate all resort to war for the purpose of settling disputes, we can not but remember that the peace we now enjoy had to be won by the sword and that if the rights of our country are to be defended we can not rely for that purpose upon anyone but ourselves. we can not shirk the responsibility, which is the first requisite of all government, of preserving its own integrity and maintaining the rights of its own citizens. it is only in accordance with these principles that we can establish any lasting foundations for an honorable and permanent peace. it is for these reasons that our country, like any other country, proposes to provide itself with an army and navy supported by a merchant marine. yet these are not for competition with any other power. for years we have besought nations to disarm. we have recently expressed our willingness at geneva to enter into treaties for the limitation of all types of warships according to the ratio adopted at the washington conference. this offer is still pending. while we are and shall continue to be armed it is not as a menace, but rather a common assurance of tranquility to all the peaceloving people of the world. for us to do any less would be to disregard our obligations, evade our responsibilities, and jeopardize our national honor. veterans this country, not only because it is bound by honor but because of the satisfaction derived from it, has always lavished its bounty upon its veterans. for years a service pension has been bestowed upon the grand army on reaching a certain age. like provision has been made for the survivors of the spanish war. a liberal future compensation has been granted to all the veterans of the world war. but it is in the case of the, disabled and the dependents that the government exhibits its greatest solicitude. this work is being well administered by the veterans' bureau. the main unfinished feature is that of hospitalization. this requirement is being rapidly met. various veteran bodies will present to you recommendations which should have your careful consideration. at the last session we increased our annual expenditure for pensions and relief on account of the veterans of three wars. while i approve of proper relief for all suffering, i do not favor any further extension of our pension system at this time. alien property we still have in the possession of the government the alien property. it has always been the policy of america to hold that private enemy property should not be confiscated in time of war. this principle we have scrupulously observed. as this property is security for the claims of our citizens and our government, we can not relinquish it without adequate provision for their reimbursement. legislation for the return of this property, accompanied by suitable provisions for the liquidation of the claims of our citizens and our treasury, should be adopted. if our government releases to foreigners the security which it holds for americans, it must at the same time provide satisfactory safeguards for meeting american claims. prohibition the duly authorized public authorities of this country have made prohibition the law of the land. acting under the constitution the congress and the legislatures of practically all the, states have adopted legislation for its enforcement. some abuses have arisen which require reform. under the law the national government has entrusted to the treasury department the especial duty of regulation and enforcement. such supplementary legislation as it requires to meet existing conditions should be carefully and speedily enacted. failure to support the constitution and observe the law ought not to be tolerated by public opinion. especially those in public places, who have taken their oath to support the constitution, ought to be most scrupulous in its observance. officers of the department of justice throughout the country should be vigilant in enforcing the law, but local authorities, which had always been mainly responsible for the enforcement of law in relation to intoxicating liquor, ought not to seek evasion by attempting to shift the burden wholly upon the federal agencies. under the constitution the states are jointly charged with the nation in providing for the enforcement of the prohibition amendment. some people do not like the amendment, some do not like other parts of the constitution, some do not like any of it. those who entertain such sentiments have a perfect right to seek through legal methods for a change. but for any of our inhabitants to observe such parts of the constitution as they like, while disregarding others, is a doctrine that would break down all protection of life and property and destroy the american system of ordered liberty. foreign relations the foreign policy of this government is well known. it is one of peace based on that mutual respect that arises from mutual regard for international rights arid the discharge of international obligations. it is our purpose to promote understanding and good will between ourselves and all other people. the american people are altogether lacking in an appreciation of the tremendous good fortune that surrounds their international position. we have no traditional enemies. we are not embarrassed over any disputed territory. we have no possessions that are coveted by others; they have none that are coveted by us. our borders are unfortified. we fear no one; no one fears us. all the world knows that the whole extent of our influence is against war and in favor of peace, against the use of force and in favor of negotiation, arbitration, and adjudication as a method of adjusting international differences. we look with disfavor upon all aggressive warfare. we are strong enough so that no one can charge us with weakness if we are slow to anger. our place is sufficiently established so that we need not be sensitive over trifles. our resources, are large enough so that we can afford to be generous. at the same time we are a nation among nations and recognize a responsibility not only to ourselves, but in the interests of a stable and enlightened civilization, to protect and defend the international rights of our government and our citizens. it is because of our historical detachment and the generations of comparative indifference toward it by other nations that our public is inclined to consider altogether too seriously the reports that we are criticized abroad. we never had a larger foreign trade than at the present time. our good offices were never more sought and the necessity for our assistance and cooperation was never more universally declared in any time of peace. we know that the sentiments which we entertain toward all other nations are those of the most sincere friendship and good will and of all unbounded desire to help, which we are perfectly willing to have judged by their fruits. in our efforts to adjust our international obligations we have met with a response which, when everything is considered, i believe history will record as a most remarkable and gratifying demonstration of the sanctity with which civilized nations undertake to discharge their mutual obligations. debt settlements have been negotiated with practically all of those who owed us and all finally adjusted but two, which are, in process of ratification. when we consider the real sacrifice that will be necessary on the part of other nations, considering all their circumstances, to meet their agreed payments, we ought to hold them in increased admiration and respect. it is true that we have extended to them very generous treatment, but it is also true that they have agreed to repay its all that we loaned to them and some interest. a special conference on the chinese customs tariff provided for by the treaty between the nine powers relating to the chinese customs tariff signed at washington on february 6, 1922, was called by the chinese government to meet at peking, on october 26, 1925. we participated in this conference through fully empowered delegates and, with good will, endeavored to cooperate with the other participating powers with a view to putting into effect promises made to china at the washington conference, and considering any reasonable proposal that might be made by the chinese government for the revision of the treaties on the subject of china's tariff. with these aims in view the american delegation at the outset of the conference proposed to put into effect the surtaxes provided for by the washington treaty and to proceed immediately to the negotiation of a treaty, which, among other things, was to make provision for the abolition of taxes collected on goods in transit, remove the tariff restrictions in existing treaties, and put into effect the national tariff law of china. early in april of the present year the central chinese government was ousted from power by opposing warring factions. it became impossible under the circumstances to continue the negotiations. finally, on july 3, the delegates of the foreign powers, including those of the united states, issued a statement expressing their unanimous and earnest desire to proceed with the work of the conference at the earliest possible moment when the delegates of the chinese government are in a position to resume discussions with the foreign delegates of the problems before the conference. we are prepared to resume the negotiations thus interrupted whenever a government representing the chinese people and acting on their behalf presents itself. the fact that constant warfare between contending chinese factions has rendered it impossible to bring these negotiations to a successful conclusion is a matter of deep regret. throughout these conflicts we have maintained a position of the most careful neutrality. our naval vessels in asiatic waters, pursuant to treaty rights, have been used only for the protection of american citizens. silas h. strawn, esq., was sent to china as american commissioner to cooperate with commissioners of the other powers in the establishment of a commission to inquire into the present practice of extraterritorial jurisdiction in china, with a view to reporting to the governments of the several powers their findings of fact in regard to these matters. the commission commenced its work in january, 1926, and agreed upon a joint report which was signed on september 16, 1926. the commission's report has been received and is being studied with a view to determining our future policy in regard to the question of extraterritorial privileges under treaties between the united states and china. the preparatory commission for the disarmament conference met at geneva on may 18 and its work has been proceeding almost continuously since that date. it would be premature to attempt to form a judgment as to the progress that has been made. the commission has had before it a comprehensive list of questions touching upon all aspects of the question of the limitation of armament. in the commission's discussions many differences of opinion have developed. however, i am hopeful that at least some measure of agreement will be reached as the discussions continue. the american representation on the commission has consistently tried to be helpful, and has kept before it the practical objective to which the commission is working, namely, actual agreements for the limitation of armaments. our representatives will continue their work in that direction. one of the most encouraging features of the commission's work thus far has been the agreement in principle among the naval experts of a majority of the powers parties to the washington treaty limiting naval armament upon methods and standards for the comparison and further limitation of naval armament. it is needless to say that at the proper time i shall be prepared to proceed along practical lines to the conclusion of agreements carrying further the work begun at the washington conference in 1921. department reports many important subjects which it is impossible even to mention in the short space of an annual message you will find fully discussed in the departmental reports. a failure to include them here is not to be taken as indicating any lack of interest, but only a disinclination to state inadequately what has been much better done in other documents. the capital city we are embarking on an ambitious building program for the city of washington. the memorial bridge is under way with all that it holds for use and beauty. new buildings are soon contemplated. this program should represent the best that exists in the art and science of architecture. into these structures which must be considered as of a permanent nature ought to go the aspirations of the nation, its ideals expressed in forms of beauty. if our country wishes to compete with others, let it not be in the support of armaments but in the making of a beautiful capital city. let it express the soul of america. whenever an american is at the seat of his government, however traveled and cultured he may be, he ought to find a city of stately proportion, symmetrically laid out and adorned with the best that there is in architecture, which would arouse his imagination and stir his patriotic pride. in the coming years washington should be not only the art center of our own country but the art center of the world. around it should center all that is best in science, in learning, in letters, and in art. these are the results that justify the creation of those national resources with which we have been favored. american ideals america is not and must not be a country without ideals. they are useless if they are only visionary; they are only valuable if they are practical. a nation can not dwell constantly on the mountain tops. it has to be replenished and sustained through the ceaseless toil of the less inspiring valleys. but its face ought always to be turned upward, its vision ought always to be fixed on high. we need ideals that can be followed in daily life, that can be translated into terms of the home. we can not expect to be relieved from toil, but we do expect to divest it of degrading conditions. work is honorable; it is entitled to an honorable recompense. we must strive mightily, but having striven there is a defect in our political and social system if we are not in general rewarded with success. to relieve the land of the burdens that came from the war, to release to the individual more of the fruits of his own industry, to increase his earning capacity and decrease his hours of labor, to enlarge the circle of his vision through good roads and better transportation, to lace before him the opportunity for education both in science and in art, to leave him free to receive the inspiration of religion, all these are ideals which deliver him from the servitude of the body and exalt him to the service of the soul. through this emancipation from the things that are material, we broaden our dominion over the things that are spiritual.\"\n",
      " \"members of the congress: it is gratifying to report that for the fourth consecutive year the state of the union in general is good. we are at peace. the country as a whole has had a prosperity never exceeded. wages are at their highest range, employment is plentiful. some parts of agriculture and industry have lagged; some localities have suffered from storm and flood. but such losses have been absorbed without serious detriment to our great economic structure. stocks of goods are moderate and a wholesome caution is prevalent. rates of interest for industry, agriculture, and government have been reduced. savers and investors are providing capital for new construction in industry and public works. the purchasing power of agriculture has increased. if the people maintain that confidence which they are entitled to have in themselves, in each other, and in america, a comfortable prosperity will continue. constructive economy without constructive economy in government expenditures we should not now be enjoying these results or these prospects. because we are not now physically at war, some people are disposed to forget that our war debt still remains. the nation must make financial sacrifices, accompanied by a stern self-denial in public expenditures, until we have conquered the disabilities of our public finance. while our obligation to veterans and dependents is large and continuing, the heavier burden of the national debt is being steadily eliminated. at the end of this fiscal year it will be reduced from about $26,600,000,000 to about $17,975,000,000. annual interest, including war savings, will have been reduced from $1,055,000,000 to $670,0001,000. the sacrifices of the people, the economy of the government, are showing remarkable results. they should be continued for the purpose of relieving the nation of the burden of interest and debt and releasing revenue for internal improvements and national development. not only the amount, but the rate, of government interest has been reduced. callable bonds have been refunded and paid, so that during this year the average rate of interest on the present public debt for the first time fell below 4 per cent. keeping the credit of the nation high is a tremendously profitable operation. tax reduction the immediate fruit of economy and the retirement of the public debt is tax reduction. the annual saving in interest between 1925 and 1929 is $212,000,000. without this no bill to relieve the taxpayers would be worth proposing. the three measures already enacted leave our government revenues where they are not oppressive. exemptions, have been increased until 115,000,000 people make but 2,500,000 individual taxable returns, so that further reduction should be mainly for the purpose of removing inequalities. the secretary of the treasury has recommended a measure which would give us a much better balanced system of taxation and without oppression produce sufficient revenue. it has my complete support. unforeseen contingencies requiring money are always arising. our probable surplus for june 30, 1929, is small. a slight depression in business would greatly reduce our revenue because of our present method of taxation. the people ought to take no selfish attitude of pressing for removing moderate and fair taxes which might produce a deficit. we must keep our budget balanced for each year. that is the corner stone of our national credit, the trifling price we pay to command the lowest rate of interest of any great power in the world. any surplus can be applied to debt reduction, and debt reduction is tax reduction. under the present circumstances it would be far better to leave the rates as they are than to enact a bill carrying the peril of a deficit. this is not a problem to be approached in a narrow or partisan spirit. all of those who participate in finding a reasonable solution will be entitled to participate in any credit that accrues from it without regard to party. the congress has already demonstrated that tax legislation can be removed from purely political consideration into the realm of patriotic business principles. any bill for tax reduction should be written by those who are responsible for raising, managing, and expending the finances of the government. if special interests, too often selfish, always uninformed of the national needs as a whole, with hired agents using their proposed beneficiaries as engines of propaganda, are permitted to influence the withdrawal of their property from taxation, we shall have a law that is unbalanced and unjust, bad for business, bad for the country, probably resulting in a deficit, with disastrous financial consequences. the constitution has given the members of the congress sole authority to decide what tax measures shall be presented for approval. while welcoming information from any quarter, the congress should continue to exercise its own judgment in a matter so vital and important to all the interests of the country as taxation. national defense being a nation relying not on force, but on fair dealing and good will, to maintain peace with others, we have provided a moderate military force in a form adapted solely to defense. it should be continued with a very generous supply of officers and with the present base of personnel, subject to fluctuations which may be temporarily desirable. the five-year program for our air forces is in keeping with this same policy and commensurate with the notable contributions of america to the science of aeronautics. the provisions of the law lately enacted are being executed as fast as the practical difficulties of an orderly and stable development permit. while our army is small, prudence requires that it should be kept in a high state of efficiency and provided with such supplies as would permit of its immediate expansion. the garrison ration has lately been increased. recommendations for an appropriation of $6,166,000 for new housing made to the previous congress failed to pass. while most of the army is well housed, some of it which is quartered in wartime training camps is becoming poorly housed. in the past three years $12,533,000 have been appropriated for reconstruction and repairs, and an authorization has been approved of $22,301,000 for new housing, under which $8,070,000 has already been appropriated. a law has also been passed, complying with the request of the war department, allocating funds received from the sale of buildings and land for housing purposes. the work, however, is not completed, so that other appropriations are being recommended. our navy is likewise a weapon of defense. we have a foreign commerce and ocean lines of trade unsurpassed by any other country. we have outlying territory in the two great oceans and long stretches of seacoast studded with the richest cities in the world. we are responsible for the protection of a large population and the greatest treasure ever bestowed upon any people. we are charged with an international duty of defending the panama canal. to meet these responsibilities we need a very substantial sea armament. it needs aircraft development, which is being provided under the five-year program. it needs submarines as soon as the department decides upon the best type of construction. it needs airplane carriers and a material addition to its force of cruisers. we can plan for the future and begin a moderate building program. this country has put away the old world policy of competitive armaments. it can never be relieved of the responsibility of adequate national defense. we have one treaty secured by an unprecedented attitude of generosity on our part for a limitation in naval armament. after most careful preparation, extending over months, we recently made every effort to secure a three-power treaty to the same end. we were granted much cooperation by japan, but we were unable to come to an agreement with great britain. while the results of the conference were of considerable value, they were mostly of a negative character. we know now that no agreement can be reached which will be inconsistent with a considerable building program on our part. we are ready and willing to continue the preparatory investigations on the general subject of limitation of armaments which have been started under the auspices of the league of nations. we have a considerable cruiser tonnage, but a part of it is obsolete. everyone knew that had a three-power agreement been reached it would have left us with the necessity of continuing our building program. the failure to agree should not cause us to build either more or less than we otherwise should. any future treaty of limitation will call on us for more ships. we should enter on no competition. we should refrain from no needful program. it should be made clear to all the world that lacking a definite agreement, the attitude of any other country is not to be permitted to alter our own policy. it should especially be demonstrated that propaganda will not cause us to change our course. where there is no treaty limitation, the size of the navy which america is to have will be solely for america to determine. no outside influence should enlarge it or diminish it. but it should be known to all that our military power holds no threat of aggrandizement. it is a guaranty of peace and security at home, and when it goes abroad it is an instrument for the protection of the legal rights of our citizens under international law, a refuge in time of disorder, and always the servant of world peace. wherever our flag goes the rights of humanity increase. merchant marine the united states government fleet is transporting a large amount of freight and reducing its drain on the treasury. the shipping board is constantly under pressure, to which it too often yields, to protect private interests, rather than serve the public welfare. more attention should be given to merchant ships as an auxiliary of the navy. the possibility of including their masters and crews in the naval reserve, with some reasonable compensation, should be thoroughly explored as a method of encouraging private operation of shipping. public operation is not a success. no investigation, of which i have caused several to be made, has failed to report that it could not succeed or to recommend speedy transfer to private ownership. our exporters and importers are both indifferent about using american ships. it should be our policy to keep our present vessels in repair and dispose of them as rapidly as possible, rather than undertake any new construction. their operation is a burden on the national treasury, for which we are not receiving sufficient benefits. commercial aviation a rapid growth is taking place in aeronautics. the department of commerce has charge of the inspection and licensing system and the construction of national airways. almost 8,000 miles are already completed and about 4,000 miles more contemplated. nearly 4,400 miles are now equipped and over 3,000 miles more will have lighting and emergency landing fields by next july. air mail contracts are expected to cover 24 of these lines. daily airway flying is nearly 15,000 miles and is expected to reach 25,000 miles early next year. flights for other purposes exceed 22,000 miles each day. over 900 airports, completed and uncompleted, have been laid out. the demand for aircraft has greatly increased. the policy already adopted by the congress is producing the sound development of this coming industry. western hemisphere air mail private enterprise is showing much interest in opening up aviation service to mexico and central and south america. we are particularly solicitous to have the united states take a leading part in this development. it is understood that the governments of our sister countries would be willing to cooperate. their physical features, the undeveloped state of their transportation, make an air service especially adaptable to their usage. the post office department should be granted power to make liberal long-term contracts for carrying our mail, and authority should be given to the army and the navy to detail aviators and planes to cooperate with private enterprise in establishing such mail service with the consent of the countries concerned. a committee of the cabinet will later present a report on this subject. good roads the importance and benefit of good roads is more and more coming to be appreciated. the national government has been making liberal contributions to encourage their construction. the results and benefits have been very gratifying. national participation, however, should be confined to trunk-line systems. the national tax on automobiles is now nearly sufficient to meet this outlay. this tax is very small, and on low-priced cars is not more than $2 or $3 each year. while the advantage of having good roads is very large, the desire for improved highways is not limited to our own country. it should and does include all the western hemisphere. the principal points in canada are already accessible. we ought to lend our encouragement in any way we can for more good roads to all the principal points in this hemisphere south of the rio grande. it has been our practice to supply these countries with military and naval advisers, when they have requested it, to assist them in national defense. the arts of peace are even more important to them and to us. authority should be given by law to provide them at their request with engineering advisers for the construction of roads and bridges. in some of these countries already wonderful progress is being made in road building, but the engineering features are often very exacting and the financing difficult. private interests should look with favor on all reasonable loans sought by these countries to open such main lines of travel. this general subject has been promoted by the pan american congress of highways, which will convene again at rio de janeiro in july, 1928. it is desirable that the congress should provide for the appointment of delegates to represent the government of the united states. cuban parcel post we have a temporary parcel-post convention with cuba. the advantage of it is all on our side. during 1926 we shipped twelve times as many parcels, weighing twenty-four times as much, as we received. this convention was made on the understanding that we would repeal an old law prohibiting the importation of cigars and cigarettes in quantities less than 3,000 enacted in 1866 to discourage smuggling, for which it has long been unnecessary. this law unjustly discriminates against an important industry of cuba. its repeal has been recommended by the treasury and post office departments. unless this is done our merchants and railroads will find themselves deprived of this large parcel-post business after the 1st of next march, the date of the expiration of the convention, which has been extended upon the specific understanding that it would expire at that time unless this legislation was enacted. we purchase large quantities of tobacco made in cuba. it is not probable that our purchases would be any larger if this law was repealed, while it would be an advantage to many other industries in the united states. insular possessions conditions in the philippine islands have been steadily improved. contentment and good order prevail. roads, irrigation works, harbor improvements, and public buildings are being constructed. public education and sanitation have been advanced. the government is in a sound financial condition. these immediate results were especially due to the administration of gov. gen. leonard wood. the six years of his governorship marked a distinct improvement in the islands and rank as one of the outstanding accomplishments of this distinguished man. his death is a loss to the nation and the islands. greater progress could be made, more efficiency could be put. into administration, if the congress would undertake to expend, through its appropriating power, all or a part of the customs revenues which are now turned over to the philippine treasury. the powers of the auditor of the islands also need revision and clarification. the government of the islands is about 98 per cent in the hands of the filipinos. an extension of the policy of self-government will be hastened by the demonstration on their part of their desire and their ability to carry out cordially and efficiently the provisions of the organic law enacted by the congress for the government of the islands. it would be well for a committee of the congress to visit the islands every two years. a fair degree of progress is being made in porto rico. its agricultural products are increasing; its treasury position, which has given much concern, shows improvement. i am advised by the governor that educational facilities are still lacking. roads are being constructed, which he represents are the first requisite for building schoolhouses. the loyalty of the island to the united states is exceedingly gratifying. a memorial will be presented to you requesting authority to have the governor elected by the people of porto rico. this was never done in the case of our own territories. it is admitted that education outside of the towns is as yet very deficient. until it has progressed further the efficiency of the government and the happiness of the people may need the guiding hand of an appointed governor. as it is not contemplated that any change should be made immediately, the general subject may well have the thoughtful study of the congress. panama canal the number of commercial ships passing through the panama canal has increased from 3,967 in 1923 to 5,475 in 1927. the total amount of tolls turned into the treasury is over $166,000,000, while all the operations of the canal have yielded a surplus of about $80,000,000. in order to provide additional storage of water and give some control over the floods of the chagres river, it is proposed to erect a dam to cost about $12,000,000 at alhajuela. it will take some five years to complete this work. agriculture the past year has seen a marked improvement in the general condition of agriculture. production is better balanced and without acute shortage or heavy surplus. costs have been reduced and the average output of the worker increased. the level of farm prices has risen while others have fallen, so that the purchasing power of the farmer is approaching a normal figure. the individual farmer is entitled to great credit for the progress made since 1921. he has adjusted his production and through cooperative organizations and other methods improved his marketing. he is using authenticated facts and employing sound methods which other industries are obliged to use to secure stability and prosperity. the old-fashioned haphazard system is being abandoned, economics are being applied to ascertain the best adapted unit of land, diversification is being promoted, and scientific methods are being used in production, and business principles in marketing. agriculture has not fully recovered from postwar depression. the fact is that economic progress never marches forward in a straight line. it goes in waves. one part goes ahead, while another halts and another recedes. everybody wishes agriculture to prosper. any sound and workable proposal to help the farmer will have the earnest support of the government. their interests are not all identical. legislation should assist as many producers in as many regions as possible. it should be the aim to assist the farmer to work out his own salvation socially and economically. no plan will be of any permanent value to him which does not leave him standing on his own foundation. in the past the government has spent vast sums to bring land under cultivation. lt. is apparent that this has reached temporarily the saturation point. we have had a surplus of production and a poor market for land, which has only lately shown signs of improvement. the main problem which is presented for solution is one of dealing with a surplus of production. it is useless to propose a temporary expedient. what is needed is permanency and stability. government price fixing is known to be unsound and bound to result in disaster. a government subsidy would work out in the same way. it can not be sound for all of the people to hire some of the people to produce a crop which neither the producers nor the rest of the people want. price fixing and subsidy will both increase the surplus, instead of diminishing it. putting the government directly into business is merely a combination of subsidy and price fixing aggravated by political pressure. these expedients would lead logically to telling the farmer by law what and how much he should plant and where he should plant it, and what and how much he should sell and where he should sell it. the most effective means of dealing with surplus crops is to reduce the surplus acreage. while this can not be done by the individual farmer, it can be done through the organizations already in existence, through the information published by the department of agriculture, and especially through banks and others who supply credit refusing to finance an acreage manifestly too large. it is impossible to provide by law for an assured success and prosperity for all those who engage in farming. if acreage becomes overextended, the government can not assume responsibility for it. the government can, however, assist cooperative associations and other organizations in orderly marketing and handling a surplus clearly due to weather and seasonal conditions, in order to save the producer from preventable loss. while it is probably impossible to secure this result at a single step, and much will have to be worked out by trial and rejection, a beginning could be made by setting up a federal board or commission of able and experienced men in marketing, granting equal advantages under this board to the various agricultural commodities and sections of the country, giving encouragement to the cooperative movement in agriculture, and providing a revolving loan fund at a moderate rate of interest for the necessary financing. such legislation would lay the foundation for a permanent solution of the surplus problem. this is not a proposal to lend more money to the farmer, who is already fairly well financed, but to lend money temporarily to experimental marketing associations which will no doubt ultimately be financed by the regularly established banks, as were the temporary operations of the war finance corporation. cooperative marketing especially would be provided with means of buying or building physical properties. the national government has almost entirely relieved the farmer from income taxes by successive tax reductions, but state and local taxes have increased, putting on him a grievous burden. a policy of rigid economy should be applied to state and local expenditures. this is clearly within the legislative domain of the states. the federal government has also improved our banking structure and system of agricultural credits. the farmer will be greatly benefited by similar action in many states. the department of agriculture is undergoing changes in organization in order more completely to separate the research and regulatory divisions, that each may be better administered. more emphasis is being placed on the research program, not only by enlarging the appropriations for state experiment stations but by providing funds for expanding the research work of the department. it is in this direction that much future progress can be expected. the protective tariff the present tariff rates supply the national treasury with well over $600,000,000 of annual revenue. yet, about 65 per cent of our imports come in duty free. of the remaining 35 per cent of imports on which duties are laid about 23 per cent consists of luxuries and agricultural products, and the balance of about 12 per cent, amounting, to around $560,000,000 is made up of manufactures and merchandise. as no one is advocating any material reduction in the rates on agriculture or luxuries, it is only the comparatively small amount of about $560,000,000 of other imports that are really considered in any discussion of reducing tariff rates. while this amount, duty free, would be large enough seriously to depress many lines of business in our own country, it is of small importance when spread over the rest of the world. it is often stated that a reduction of tariff rates on industry would benefit agriculture. it would be interesting to know to what commodities it is thought this could be applied. everything the farmer uses in farming is already on the free list. nearly everything he sells is protected. it would seem to be obvious that it is better for tile country to have the farmer raise food to supply the domestic manufacturer than the foreign manufacturer. in one case our country would have only the farmer; in the other it would have the farmer and the manufacturer. assuming that europe would have more money if it sold us larger amounts of merchandise, it is not certain it would consume more food, or, if it did, that its purchases would be made in this country. undoubtedly it would resort to the cheapest market, which is by no means ours. the largest and best and most profitable market for the farmer in the world is our own domestic market. any great increase in manufactured imports means the closing of our own plants. nothing would be worse for agriculture. probably no one expects a material reduction in the rates on manufactures while maintaining the rates on agriculture. a material reduction in either would be disastrous to tile farmer. it would mean a general shrinkage of values, a deflation of prices, a reduction of wages, a general depression carrying our people down to the low standard of living in our competing countries. it is obvious that this would not improve but destroy our market for imports, which is best served by maintaining our present high purchasing power under which in the past five years imports have increased 63 per cent. farm loan system it is exceedingly important that the federal land and joint-stock land banks should furnish the best possible service for agriculture. certain joint-stock banks have fallen into improper and unsound practices, resulting in the indictment of the officials of three of them. more money has been provided for examinations, and at the instance of the treasury rules and regulations of the federal farm board have been revised. early last may three of its members resigned. their places were filled with men connected with the war finance corporation. eugene meyer being designated as farm loan commissioner. the new members have demonstrated their ability in the field of agricultural finance in the extensive operations of he war finance corporation. three joint-stock banks have gone into receivership. it is necessary to preserve the public confidence in this system in order to find a market for their bonds. a recent flotation was made at a record low rate of 4 per cent. careful supervision is absolutely necessary to protect the investor and enable these banks to exercise their chief function in serving agriculture. muscle shoals the last year has seen considerable changes in the problem of muscle shoals. development of other methods show that nitrates can probably be produced at less cost than by the use of hydroelectric power. extensive investigation made by the department of war indicates that the nitrate plants on this project are of little value for national defense and can probably be disposed of within two years. the oxidation part of the plants, however, should be retained indefinitely. this leaves this project mostly concerned with power. it should, nevertheless, continue to be dedicated to agriculture. it is probable that this desire can be best served by disposing of the plant and applying the revenues received from it to research for methods of more economical production of concentrated fertilizer and to demonstrations and other methods of stimulating its use on the farm. but in disposing of the property preference should be given to proposals to use all or part of it for nitrate production and fertilizer manufacturing. flood control for many years the federal government has been building a system of dikes along the mississippi river for protection against high water. during the past season the lower states were overcome by a most disastrous flood. many thousands of square miles were inundated a great many lives were lost, much livestock was drowned, and a very heavy destruction of property was inflicted upon the inhabitants. the american red cross at once went to the relief of the stricken communities. appeals for contributions have brought in over $17,000,000. the federal government has provided services, equipment, and supplies probably amounting to about $7,000,000 more. between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000 in addition have been provided by local railroads, the states, and their political units. credits have been arranged by the farm loan board, and three emergency finance corporations with a total capital of $3,000,000 have insured additional resources to the extent of $12,000,000. through these means the 700,000 people in the flooded areas have been adequately supported. provision has been made to care for those in need until after the 1st of january. the engineering corps of the army has contracted to close all breaks in the dike system before the next season of high water. a most thorough and elaborate survey of the whole situation has been made and embodied in a report with recommendations for future flood control, which will be presented to the congress. the carrying out of their plans will necessarily extend over a series of years. they will call for a raising and strengthening of the dike system with provision for emergency spillway's and improvements for the benefit of navigation. under the present law the land adjacent to the dikes has paid one-third of the cost of their construction. this has been a most extraordinary concession from the plan adopted in relation to irrigation, where the general rule has been that the land benefited should bear the entire expense. it is true, of course, that the troublesome waters do not originate on the land to be reclaimed, but it is also true that such waters have a right of way through that section of the country and the land there is charged with that easement. it is the land of this region that is to be benefited. to say that it is unable to bear any expense of reclamation is the same thing as saying that it is not worth reclaiming. because of expenses incurred and charges already held against this land, it seems probable that some revision will have to be made concerning the proportion of cost which it should bear. but it is extremely important that it should pay enough so that those requesting improvements will be charged with some responsibility for their cost, and the neighborhood where works are constructed have a pecuniary interest in preventing waste and extravagance and securing a wise and economical expenditure of public funds. it is necessary to look upon this emergency as a national disaster. it has been so treated from its inception. our whole people have provided with great generosity for its relief. most of the departments of the federal government have been engaged in the same effort. the governments of the afflicted areas, both state and municipal, can not be given too high praise for the courageous and helpful way in which they have come to the rescue of the people. if the sources directly chargeable can not meet the demand, the national government should not fail to provide generous relief. this, however, does not mean restoration. the government is not an insurer of its citizens against the hazard of the elements. we shall always have flood and drought, heat and cold, earthquake and wind, lightning and tidal wave, which are all too constant in their afflictions. the government does not undertake to reimburse its citizens for loss and damage incurred under such circumstances. it is chargeable, however, with the rebuilding of public works and the humanitarian duty of relieving its citizens from distress. the people in the flooded area and their representatives have approached this problem in the most generous and broad-minded way. they should be met with a like spirit on the part of the national government. this is all one country. the public needs of each part must be provided for by the public at large. no required relief should be refused. an adequate plan should be adopted to prevent a recurrence of this disaster in order that the people may restore to productivity and comfort their fields and their towns. legislation by this congress should be confined to our principal and most pressing problem, the lower mississippi, considering tributaries only so far as they materially affect the main flood problem. a definite federal program relating to our waterways was proposed when the last congress authorized a comprehensive survey of all the important streams of the country in order to provide for their improvement, including flood control, navigation, power, and irrigation. other legislation should wait pending a report on this survey. the recognized needs of the mississippi should not be made a vehicle for carrying other projects. all proposals for development should stand on their own merits. any other method would result in ill-advised conclusions, great waste of money, and instead of promoting would delay the orderly and certain utilization of our water resources. very recently several of the new england states have suffered somewhat similarly from heavy rainfall and high water. no reliable estimate of damage has yet been computed, but it is very large to private and public property. the red cross is generously undertaking what is needed for immediate relief, repair and reconstruction of houses, restocking of domestic animals, and food, clothing, and shelter. a considerable sum of money will be available through the regular channels in the department of agriculture for reconstruction of highways. it may be necessary to grant special aid for this purpose. complete reports of what is required will undoubtedly be available early in the session. inland navigation the congress in its last session authorized the general improvements necessary to provide the mississippi waterway system with better transportation. stabilization of the levels of the great lakes and their opening to the sea by an effective shipway remain to be considered. since the last session the board of engineers of the war department has made a report on the proposal for a canal through the state of new york, and the joint board of engineers, representing canada and the united states, has finished a report on the st. lawrence river. both of these boards conclude that the st. lawrence project is cheaper, affords a more expeditious method of placing western products in european markets, and will cost less to operate. the state department has requested the canadian government to negotiate treaties necessary to provide for this improvement. it will also be necessary to secure an agreement with canada to put in works necessary to prevent fluctuation in the levels of the great lakes. legislation is desirable for the construction of a dam at boulder canyon on the colorado river, primarily as a method of flood control and irrigation. a secondary result would be a considerable power development and a source of domestic water supply for southern california. flood control is clearly a national problem, and water supply is a government problem, but every other possibility should be exhausted before the federal government becomes engaged in the power business. the states which are interested ought to reach mutual agreement. this project is in reality their work. if they wish the federal government to undertake it, they should not hesitate to make the necessary concessions to each other. this subject is fully discussed in the annual report of the secretary of the interior. the columbia river basin project is being studied and will be one to be considered at some future time. the inland waterways corporation is proving successful and especially beneficial to agriculture. a survey is being made to determine its future needs. it has never been contemplated that if inland rivers were opened to navigation it would then be necessary for the federal government to provide the navigation. such a request is very nearly the equivalent of a declaration that their navigation is not profitable, that the commodities which they are to carry can be taken at a cheaper rate by some other method, in which case the hundreds of millions of dollars proposed to be expended for opening rivers to navigation would be not only wasted, but would entail further constant expenditures to carry the commodities of private persons for less than cost. the policy is well established that the government should open public highways on land and on water, but for use of the public in their private capacity. it has put on some demonstration barge lines, but always with the expectation that if they prove profitable they would pass into private hands and if they do not prove profitable they will be withdrawn. the problems of transportation over inland waterways should be taken up by private enterprise, so that the public will have the advantage of competition in service. it is expected that some of our lines can be sold, some more demonstration work done, and that with the completion of the ohio project a policy of private operation can be fully developed. prohibition after more than two generations of constant debate, our country adopted a system of national prohibition under all the solemnities involved in an amendment to the federal constitution. in obedience to this mandate the congress and the states, with one or two notable exceptions, have passed required laws for its administration and enforcement. this imposes upon the citizenship of the country, and especially on all public officers, not only the duty to enforce, but the obligation to observe the sanctions of this constitutional provision and its resulting laws. if this condition could be secured, all question concerning prohibition would cease. the federal government is making every effort to accomplish these results through careful organization, large appropriations, and administrative effort. smuggling has been greatly cut down, the larger sources of supply for illegal sale have been checked, and by means of injunction and criminal prosecution the process of enforcement is being applied. the same vigilance on the part of local governments would render these efforts much more successful. the federal authorities propose to discharge their obligation for enforcement to the full extent of their ability. the negro history does not anywhere record so much progress made in the same length of time as that which has been accomplished by the negro race in the united states since the emancipation proclamation. they have come up from slavery to be prominent in education, the professions, art, science, agriculture, banking, and commerce. it is estimated that 50,000 of them are on the government pay rolls, drawing about $50,000,000 each year. they have been the recipients of presidential appointments and their professional ability has arisen to a sufficiently high plane so that they have been intrusted with the entire management and control of the great veterans hospital at tuskegee, where their conduct has taken high rank. they have shown that they have been worthy of all the encouragement which they have received. nevertheless, they are too often subjected to thoughtless and inconsiderate treatment, unworthy alike of the white or colored races. they have especially been made the target of the foul crime of lynching. for several years these acts of unlawful violence had been diminishing. in the last year they have shown an increase. every principle of order and law and liberty is opposed to this crime. the congress should enact any legislation it can under the constitution to provide for its elimination. american indian the condition of the american indian has much improved in recent years. full citizenship was bestowed upon them on june 2, 1924, and appropriations for their care and advancement have been increased. still there remains much to be done. notable increases in appropriations for the several major functions performed by the department of the interior on behalf of the indians have marked the last five years. in that time, successive annual increases in appropriations for their education total $1,804,325; for medical care, $578,000; and for industrial advancement, $205,000; or $2,582,325 more than would have been spent in the same period on the basis of appropriations for 1923 and the preceding years. the needs along health, educational, industrial and social lines however, are great, and the budget estimates for 1929 include still further increases for indian administration. to advance the time when the indians may become self-sustaining, it is my belief that the federal government should continue to improve the facilities for their care, and as rapidly as possible turn its responsibility over to the states. coal legislation authorizing a system of fuel administration and the appointment by the president of a board of mediation and conciliation in case of actual or threatened interruption of production is needed. the miners themselves are now seeking information and action from the government, which could readily be secured through such a board. it is believed that a thorough investigation and reconsideration of this proposed policy by the congress will demonstrate that this recommendation is sound and should be adopted. petroleum conservation the national government is undertaking to join in the formation of a cooperative committee of lawyers, engineers, and public officers, to consider what legislation by the states or by the congress can be adopted for the preservation and conservation of our supply of petroleum. this has come to be one of the main dependencies for transportation and power so necessary to our agricultural and industrial life. it is expected the report of this committee will be available for later congressional action. meantime, the requirement that the secretary of the interior should make certain leases of land belonging to the osage indians, in accordance with the act of march 3, 1921, should be repealed. the authority to lease should be discretionary, in order that the property of the indians way not be wasted and the public suffer a future lack of supply. alien property under treaty the property held by the alien property custodian was to be retained until suitable provision had been made for the satisfaction of american claims. while still protecting the american claimants, in order to afford every possible accommodation to the nationals of the countries whose property was held, the congress has made liberal provision for the return of a larger part of the property. all trusts under $10,000 were returned in full, and partial returns were made on the others. the total returned was approximately $350,000,000. there is still retained, however, about $250,000,000. the mixed claims commission has made such progress in the adjudication of claims that legislation can now be enacted providing for the return of the property, which should be done under conditions which will protect our government and our claimants. such a measure will be proposed, and i recommend its enactment. railroad consolidation in order to increase the efficiency of transportation and decrease its cost to the shipper, railroad consolidation must be secured. legislation is needed to simplify the necessary procedure to secure such agreements and arrangements for consolidation, always under the control and with the approval of the interstate commerce commission. pending this, no adequate or permanent reorganization can be made of the freight-rate structure. meantime, both agriculture and industry are compelled to wait for needed relief. this is purely a business question, which should be stripped of all local and partisan bias and decided on broad principles and its merits in order to promote the public welfare. a large amount of new construction and equipment, which will furnish employment for labor and markets for commodities of both factory and farm, wait on the decision of this important question. delay is holding back the progress of our country. many of the same arguments are applicable to the consolidation of the washington traction companies. veterans the care which this country has lavished on its veterans is known of all men. the yearly outlay for this purpose is about $750,000,000, or about the cost of running the federal government, outside of the post office department, before the world war. the congress will have before it recommendations of the american legion, the veterans of foreign wars, and other like organizations, which should receive candid consideration. we should continue to foster our system of compensation and rehabilitation, and provide hospitals and insurance. the magnitude of the undertaking is already so large that all requests calling for further expenditure should have the most searching scrutiny. our present system of pensions is already sufficiently liberal. it was increased by the last congress for civil and spanish war veterans and widows and for some dependents. it has been suggested that the various governmental agencies now dealing with veterans' relief be consolidated. this would bring many advantages. it is recommended that the proper committees of the congress make a thorough survey of this subject, in order to determine if legislation to secure such consolidation is desirable. education for many years it has been the policy of the federal government to encourage and foster the cause of education. large sums of money are annually appropriated to carry on vocational training. many millions go into agricultural schools. the general subject is under the immediate direction of a commissioner of education. while this subject is strictly a state and local function, it should continue to have the encouragement of the national government. i am still of the opinion that much good could be accomplished through the establishment of a department of education and relief, into which would be gathered all of these functions under one directing member of the cabinet. department of labor industrial relations have never been more peaceful. in recent months they have suffered from only one serious controversy. in all others difficulties have been adjusted, both management and labor wishing to settle controversies by friendly agreement rather than by compulsion. the welfare of women and children is being especially guarded by our department of labor. its children's bureau is in cooperation with 26 state boards and 80 juvenile courts. through its bureau of immigration it bas been found that medical examination abroad has saved prospective immigrants from much hardship. some further legislation to provide for reuniting families when either the husband or the wife is in this country, and granting more freedom for the migration of the north american indian tribes is desirable. the united states employment service has enabled about 2,000,000 men and women to gain paying positions in the last fiscal year. particular attention has been given to assisting men past middle life and in providing field labor for harvesting agricultural crops. this has been made possible in part through the service of the federal board for vocational education, which is cooperating with the states in a program to increase the technical knowledge and skill of the wage earner. public buildings construction is under way in the country and ground has been broken for carrying out a public-building program for washington. we have reached a time when not only the conveniences but the architectural beauty of the public buildings of the capital city should be given much attention. it will be necessary to purchase further land and provide the required continuing appropriations. historical celebrations provision is being made to commemorate the two hundredth anniversary of the birth of george washington. suggestion has been made for the construction of a memorial road leading from the capital to mount vernon, which may well have the consideration of the congress, and the commission intrusted with preparations for the celebration will undoubtedly recommend publication of the complete writings of washington and a series of writings by different authors relating to him. february 25, 1929. is the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the capture of fort sackville, at vincennes, in the state of indiana. this eventually brought into the union what was known as the northwest territory, embracing the region north of the ohio river between the alleghenies and the mississippi river. this expedition was led by george rogers clark. his heroic character and the importance of his victory are too little known and understood. they gave us not only this northwest territory but by means of that the prospect of reaching the pacific. the state of indiana is proposing to dedicate the site of fort sackville as a national shrine. the federal government may well make some provision for the erection under its own management of a fitting memorial at that point. foreign relations it is the policy of the united states to promote peace. we are a peaceful people and committed to the settling of disputes by amicable adjustment rather than by force. we have believed that peace can best be secured by a faithful observance on our part of the principles of international law, accompanied by patience and conciliation, and requiring of others a like treatment for ourselves. we have lately had some difference with mexico relative to the injuries inflicted upon our nationals and their property within that country. a firm adherence to our rights and a scrupulous respect for the sovereignty of mexico, both in accordance with the law of nations, coupled with patience and forbearance, it is hoped will resolve all our differences without interfering with the friendly relationship between the two governments. we have been compelled to send naval and marine forces to china to protect the lives and property of our citizens. fortunately their simple presence there has been sufficient to prevent any material loss of life. but there has been considerable loss of property. that unhappy country is torn by factions and revolutions which bid fair to last for an indefinite period. meanwhile we are protecting our citizens and stand ready to cooperate with any government which may emerge in promoting the welfare of the people of china. they have always had our friendship, and they should especially merit our consideration in these days of their distraction and distress. we were confronted by similar condition on a small scale in nicaragua. our marine and naval forces protected our citizens and their property and prevented a heavy sacrifice of life and the destruction of that country by a reversion to a state of revolution. henry l. stimson, former secretary of war, was sent there to cooperate with our diplomatic and military officers in effecting a settlement between the contending parties. this was done on the assurance that we would cooperate in restoring a state of peace where our rights would be protected by giving our assistance in the conduct of the next presidential election, which occurs in a few months. with this assurance the population returned to their peacetime pursuits, with the exception of some small roving bands of outlaws. in general, our relations with other countries can be said to have improved within the year. while having a due regard for our own affairs, the protection of our own rights, and the advancement of our own people, we can afford to be liberal toward others. our example has become of great importance in the world. it is recognized that we are independent, detached, and can and do take a disinterested position in relation to international affairs. our charity embraces the earth. our trade is far flung. our financial favors are widespread. those who are peaceful and law-abiding realize that not only have they nothing to fear from us, but that they can rely on our moral support. proposals for promoting the peace of the world will have careful consideration. but we are not a people who are always seeking for a sign. we know that peace comes from honesty and fair dealing, from moderation, and a generous regard for the rights of others. the heart of the nation is more important than treaties. a spirit of generous consideration is a more certain defense than great armaments. we should continue to promote peace by our example, and fortify it by such international covenants against war as we are permitted under our constitution to make. american progress our country has made much progress. but it has taken, and will continue to take, much effort. competition will be keen, the temptation to selfishness and arrogance will be severe, the provocations to deal harshly with weaker peoples will be many. all of these are embraced in the opportunity for true greatness. they will be overbalanced by cooperation by generosity, and a spirit of neighborly kindness. the forces of the universe are taking humanity in that direction. in doing good, in walking humbly, in sustaining its own people in ministering to other nations, america will work out its own mighty destiny.\"\n",
      " 'to the congress of the united states:no congress of the united states ever assembled, on surveying the state of the union, has met with a more pleasing prospect than that which appears at the present time. in the domestic field there is tranquility and contentment, harmonious relations between management and wage earner, freedom from industrial strife, and the highest record of years of prosperity. in the foreign field there is peace, the good will which comes from mutual understanding, and the knowledge that the problems which a short time ago appeared so ominous are yielding to the touch of manifest friendship. the great wealth created by our enterprise and industry, and saved by our economy, has had the widest distribution among our own people, and has gone out in a steady stream to serve the charity and the business of the world. the requirements of existence have passed beyond the standard of necessity into the region of luxury. enlarging production is consumed by an increasing demand at home and an expanding commerce abroad. the country can regard the present with satisfaction and anticipate the future with optimism.  the main source of these unexampled blessings lies in the integrity and character of the american people. they have had great faith, which they have supplemented with mighty works. they have been able to put trust in each other and trust in their government. their candor in dealing with foreign governments has commanded respect and confidence. yet these remarkable powers would have been exerted almost in vain without the constant cooperation and careful administration of the federal government.  we have been coming into a period which may be fairly characterized as a conservation of our national resources. wastefulness in public business and private enterprise has been displaced by constructive economy. this has been accomplished by bringing our domestic and foreign relations more and more under a reign of law. a rule of force has been giving way to a rule of reason. we have substituted for the vicious circle of increasing expenditures, increasing tax rates, and diminishing profits the charmed circle of diminishing expenditures, diminishing tax rates, and increasing profits.  four times we have made a drastic revision of our internal revenue system, abolishing many taxes and substantially reducing almost all others. each time the resulting stimulation to business has so increased taxable incomes and profits that a surplus has been produced. one-third of the national debt has been paid, while much of the other two-thirds has been refunded at lower rates, and these savings of interest and constant economies have enabled us to repeat the satisfying process of more tax reductions. under this sound and healthful encouragement the national income has increased nearly 50 per cent, until it is estimated to stand well over $90,000,000,000. it has been a method which has performed the secining miracle of leaving a much greater percentage of earnings in the hands of the taxpayers \\'with scarcely any diminution of the government revenue. that is constructive economy in the highest degree. it is the corner stone of prosperity. it should not fail to be continued.  this action began by the application of economy to public expenditure. if it is to be permanent, it must be made so by the repeated application of economy. there is no surplus on which to base further tax revision at this time. last june the estimates showed a threatened deficit for the current fiscal year of $94,000,000. under my direction the departments began saving all they could out of their present appropriations. the last tax reduction brought \\'an encouraging improvement in business, beginning early in october, which will also increase our revenue. the combination of economy and good times now indicates a surplus of about $37,000,000. this is a margin of less than 1 percent of our expenditures and makes it obvious that the treasury is in no condition to undertake increases in ditures to be made before june 30. it is necessary therefor\"stuing the present session to refrain from new appropriations for immediate outlay, or if such are absolutely required to provide for them by new revenue; otherwise, we shall reach the end of the year with the unthinkable result of an unbalanced budget. for the first time during my term of office we face that contingency. i am certain that the congress would not pass and i should not feel warranted in approving legislation which would involve us in that financial disgrace.  on the whole the finances of the government are most satisfactory. last year the national debt was reduced about $906,000,000. the refunding and retirement of the second and third liberty loans have just been brought to a successful conclusion, which will save about $75,000,0w a year in interest. the unpaid balance has been arranged  in maturities convenient for carrying out our permanent debt-paying program.  the enormous savings made have not been at the expense of any legitimate public need. the government plant has been kept up and many improvements are tinder way, while its service is fully manned and the general efficiency of operation has increased. we have been enabled to undertake many new enterprises. among these are the adjusted compensation of the veterans of the world war, which is costing us $112,000,000 a year; amortizing our liability to the civil service retirement funds, $20,000,000; increase of expenditures for rivers and harbors including flood control, $43,000,000; public buildings, $47,000,000. in 1928 we spent $50,000,000 in the adjustment of war claims and alien property. these are examples of a large list of items.  foreign reiations  when we turn from our domestic affairs to our foreign relations, we likewise perceive peace and progress. the sixth international conference of american states was held at habana last winter. it contributed to a better understanding and cooperation among the nations\\'. eleven important conventions were signed and 71 resolutions passed. pursuant to the plan then adopted, this government has invited the other 20 nations of this hemisphere to it conference on conciliation and arbitration, which meets in washington on december 10. all the nations have accepted and the expectation is justified that important progress will be made in methods for resolving international differences by means of arbitration.  during the year we have signed 11 new arbitration treaties, and 22 more are tinder negotiation.  nicaragua  when a destructive and bloody revolution lately broke out in nicaragua, at the earnest and repeated entreaties of its government i dispatched our marine forces there to protect the lives and interests of our citizens. to compose the contending parties, i sent there col. henry l. stimson, former secretary of war and now governor general of the philippine islands, who secured an agreement that warfare should cease, a national election should be held and peace should be restored. both parties conscientiously carried out this agreement, with the exception of a few bandits who later mostly surrendered or left the country. president diaz appointed brig. gen. frank r. mccoy, united states army, president of the election board, which included also one member of each political party.  a free and fair election has been held and has worked out so successfully that both parties have joined in requesting like cooperation from this country at the election four years hence, to which i have refrained from making any commitments, although our country must be gratified at such an exhibition of success and appreciation  nicaragua is regaining its prosperity and has taken a long step in the direction of peaceful self-government.  tacna-arica  the long-standing differences between chile and peru have been sufficiently composed so that diplomatic relations have been resumed by the exchange of ambassadors. negotiations are hopefully proceeding as this is written for the final adjustment of the differences over their disputed territory.  mexico  our relations with mexico are on a more satisfactory basis than at any time since their revolution. many misunderstandings have been resolved and the most frank and friendly negotiations promise a final adjustment of all unsettled questions. it is exceedingly gratifying that ambassador morrow has been able to bring our two neighboring countries, which have so many interests in common, to a position of confidence in each other and of respect for mutual sovereign rights.  china  the situation in china which a few months ago was so threatening as to call for the dispatch of a large additional force has, been much composed. the nationalist government has established itself over the country and promulgated a new organic law announcing a program intended to promote the political and economic welfare of the people. we have recognized this government, encouraged its progress, and have negotiated a treaty restoring to china complete tariff autonomy and guaranteeing our citizens against discriminations. our trade in that quarter is increasing and our forces are being reduced.  greek and austrian debts  pending before the congress is a recommendation for the settlement of the greek debt and the austrian debt. both of these are comparatively small and our country can afford to be generous. the rehabilitation of these countries await& their settlement. there would also be advantages to our trade. we could scarcely afford to be the only nation that refuses the relief which austria seeks. the congress has already granted austria a long-time moratorium, which it is understood will be waived and immediate payments begun on her debt on the same basis which we have extended to other countries.  peace treaty  one of the most important treaties ever laid before the senate of the united states will be that which the 15 nations recently signed at paris, and to which 44 other nations have declared their intention to adhere, renouncing war as a national policy and agreeing to resort only to peaceful means for the adjustment of international differences. it is the most solemn declaration against war, the most positive adherence to peace, that it is possible\\' for sovereign nations to  make. it does not supersede our inalienable sovereign right and duty of national defense or undertake to commit us before the event to any mode of action which the congress might decide to be wise. it ever the treaty should be broken. but it is a new standard in the world around which can rally the informed and enlightened opinion of nations to prevent their governments from beii4\\'forced into hostile action by the temporary outbreak of international animosities. the observance of this covenant, so simple and so straightforward, promises more for the peace of the world than any other agreement ever negotiated among the nations.  national defense  the first duty of our government to its own citizens and foreigners within its borders is the preservation of order. unless and until that duty is met a government is not even eligible for recognition among the family of nations. the advancement of world civilization likewise is dependent upon that order among the people of different countries which we term peace. to insure our citizens against the infringement of their legal rights at home and abroad, to preserve order, liberty, and peace by making the law supreme, we have an army and a navy.  both of these are organized for defensive purposes. our army could not be much reduced, but does not need to be increased. such new housing and repairs as are necessary are tinder way and the 6-year program in aviation is being put into effect in both branches of our service.  our navy, according to generally accepted standards, is deficient in cruisers. we have 10 comparatively new vessels, 22 that are old, and 8 to be built. it is evident that renewals and replacements must be provided. this matter was thoroughly canvassed at the last session of the congress and does not need restatement. the bill before the senate with the elimination of the time clause should be passed. we have no intention of competing with any other country. this building program is for necessary replacements and to meet our needs for defense.  the cost of national defense is stupendous. it has increased $118,000,000 in the past four years. the estimated expenditure for 1930 is $668,000,000. while this is made up of many items it is, after all, mostly dependent upon numbers. our defensive needs do not can for any increase in the number of men in the army or the navy. we have reached the limit of what we ought to expend for that purpose.  i wish to repeat again for the benefit of the timid and the suspicious that this country is neither militaristic nor imperialistic. many people at home and abroad, who constantly make this charge, are the same ones who are even more solicitous to have us extend assistance to foreign countries. when such assistance is granted, the inevitable result is that we have foreign interests. for us to refuse the customary support and protection of such interests would be in derogation of the sovereignty of this nation. our largest foreign interests are in the british empire, france, and italy. because we are constantly solicitous for those interests, i doubt if anyone would suppose that those countries feel we harbor toward them any militaristic or imperialistic design. as for smaller countries, we certainly do not want any of them. we are more anxious than they are to have their sovereignty respected. our entire influence is in behalf of their independence. cuba stands as a witness to our adherence to this principle.  the position of this government relative to the limitation of armaments, the results already secured, and the developments up to the present time are so well known to the congress that they do not require any restatement.  veterans  the magnitude of our present system of veterans\\' relief is without precedent, and the results have been far-reaching. for years a service pension has been granted to the grand army and lately to the survivors of the spanish-american war. at the time we entered the world war however, congress departed from the usual pension system followed by our gove2rnment. eleven years have elapsed since our laws were first enacted, initiating a system of compensation, rehabilitation, hospitalization, and insurance for the disabled of the world war and their dependents. the administration \\'of all the laws concerning relief has been a difficult task, but it can safely be stated that these measures have omitted nothing in their desire to deal generously and humanely. we should continue to foster this system and provide all the facilities necessary for adequate care. it is the conception of our government that the pension roll is an honor roll. it should include all those who are justly entitled to its benefits, but exclude all others.  annual expenditures for all forms of veterans\\' relief now approximate $765,000,000, and are increasing from year to year. it is doubtful if the peak of expenditures will be reached even under present legislation for sonic time yet to come. further amendments to the existing law will be suggested by the american legion, the veterans of foreign wars of the united states, the disabled american veterans of the world war, and other like organizations, and it may be necessary for administrative purposes, or in order to remove some existing inequalities in the present law, to make further changes. i am sure that such recommendations its may be submitted to the congress will receive your careful consideration. but because of the vast expenditure now being made, each year, with every assurance that it will increase, and because of the great liberality of the existing law, the proposal of any additional legislation dealing with this subject should receive most searching scrutiny from the congress.  you are familiar with the suggestion that the various public agencies now dealing with matters of veterans\\' relief be consolidated in one government department. some advantages to this plan seem apparent, especially in the simplification of administration find in the opportunity of bringing about a greater uniformity in the application of veterans\\' relief. i recommend that a survey be made by the proper committees of congress dealing with this subject, in order to determine whether legislation to secure this consolidation is desirable.  agriculture  the past year has been marked by notable though not uniform improvement in agriculture. the general purchasing power of farm  products and the volume of production have advanced. this means not only further progress, in overcoming the price disparity into which agriculture was plunged in 1920-21, but also increased efficiency on the part of farmers and a well-grounded confidence in the future of agriculture.  the livestock industry has attained the best balance for many years and is prospering conspicuously. dairymen, beef producers, an poultrymen are receiving substantially larger returns than last year. cotton, although lower in price than at this time last year, was produced in greater volume and the prospect for cotton incomes is favorable. but progress is never uniform in a vast and highly diversified agriculture or industry. cash grains, hay, tobacco, and potatoes will bring somewhat smaller returns this year than last. present indications are, however, that the gross farm income will be somewhat larger than in the crop year 1927-28, when the total was $12,253,000,000. the corresponding figure for 1926-27 was $12,127,000,000, and in 1925-26, $12,670,000,000. still better results would have been secured this year had there not been an undue increase in the production of certain crops. this is particularly true of potatoes, which have sold at an unremunerative price, or at a loss, as a direct result of overexpansion of acreage.  the present status of agriculture, although greatly improved over that of a few years ago, bespeaks the need of further improvemen4 which calls for determined effort of farmers themselves, encouraged and assisted by wise public policy. the government has been, and must continue to be, alive to the needs of agriculture.  in the past eight years more constructive legislation of direct benefit to agriculture has been adopted than during any other period. the department of agriculture has been broadened and reorganized to insure greater efficiency. the department is laying greater stress on the economic and business phases of agriculture. it is lending every possible assistance to cooperative marketing associations. regulatory and research work have been segregated in order that each field may be served more effectively.  i can not too strongly commend, in the field of fact finding, the research work of the department of agriculture and the state experiment stations. the department now receives annually $4,000,000 more for research than in 1921. in addition, the funds paid to the states for experimentation purposes under the purnell act constitute an annual increase in federal payments to state agricultural experiment stations of $2,400,000 over the amount appropriated in 1921. the program of support for research may wisely be continued and expanded. since 1921 we have appropriated nearly an additional $2,000,000 for extension work, and this sum is to be increased next year under authorization by the capper-ketcham act.  the surplus problem  while these developments in fundamental research, regulation, and dissemination of agricultural information are of distinct hell) to agriculture, additional effort is needed. the surplus problem demands attention. as emphasized in my last message, the government should assume no responsibility in normal times for crop surplus clearly due to overextended acreage. the government should,  however, provide reliable information as a guide to private effort; and in this connection fundamental research on prospective supply and demand, as a guide to production and marketing, should be encouraged. expenditure of public funds to bring in more new land should have most searching scrutiny, so long as our farmers face unsatisfactory prices for crops and livestock produced on land already under cultivation.  every proper effort should be made to put land to uses for which it is adapted. the reforestation of land best suited for timber production is progressing and should be encouraged, and to this end the forest taxation inquiry was instituted to afford a practical guide for public policy. improvement bas been made in grazing regulation in the forest reserves, not only to protect the ranges, but to preserve the soil from erosion. similar action is urgently needed to protect other public lands which are now overgrazed and rapidly eroding.  temporary expedients, though sometimes capable of appeasing the demands of the moment, can not permanently solve the surplus problem and might seriously aggravate it. hence putting the government directly into business, subsidies, and price fixing, and the alluring promises of political action as a substitute for private initiative, should be avoided.  the government should aid in promoting orderly marketing and in handling surpluses clearly due to weather and seasonal conditions. as a beginning there should be created a federal farm board consisting of able and experienced men empowered to advise producers\\' associations in establishing central agencies or stabilization corporations to handle surpluses, to seek wore economical means of merchandising, and to aid the producer in securing returns according to the a14 of his product. a revolving loan fund should be provided for the necessary financing until these agencies shall have developed means of financing their operations through regularly constituted credit institutions. such a bill should carry authority for raising the money, by loans or otherwise, necessary to meet the expense, as the treasury has no surplus.  agriculture has lagged behind industry in achieving that unity of effort which modern economic life demands. the cooperative movement, which is gradually building the needed organization, is in harmony with public interest and therefore merits public encouragement.  the responsibility of the states  important phases of public policy related to agriculture lie within the sphere of the states. while successive reductions in federal taxes have relieved most farmers of direct taxes to the national government, state and local levies have become a serious burden. this problem needs immediate and thorough study with a view to correction at the earliest possible moment. it will have to be made largely by the states themselves.  commerce  it is desirable that the government continue its helpful attitude toward american business. the activities of the department of commerce have contributed largely to the present satisfactory posi  tion in our international trade, which has reached about $9,000,000,000 annually. there should be no slackening of effort in that direction. it is also important that the department\\'s assistance to domestic commerce be continued. there is probably no way in which the government can aid sound economic progress more effectively than by cooperation with our business men to reduce wastes in distribution.  commercial aeronautics  continued progress in civil aviation is most gratifying. demands for airplanes and motors have taxed both the industry and the licensing and inspection service of the department of commerce to their capacity. while the compulsory licensing provisions of the air commerce act apply only to equipment and personnel engaged in interstate and foreign commerce, a federal license may be procured by anyone possessing the necessary qualifications. state legislation, local airport regulations, and insurance requirements make such a license practically indispensable. this results in uniformity of regulation and increased safety in operation, which are essential to aeronautical development. over 17,000 young men and women have now applied for federal air pilot\\'s licenses or permits. more than 80 per cent of them applied during the past year.  our national airway system exceeds 14,000 miles in length and has 7,500 miles lighted for night operations. provision has been made for lighting 4,000 miles more during the current fiscal year and equipping an equal mileage with radio facilities. three-quarters of our people are now served by these routes. with the rapid growth of air mail, express, and passenger service, this new transportation medium is daily becoming a more important factor in commerce. it is noteworthy that this development has taken place without governmental subsidies. commercial passenger flights operating on schedule have reached 13,000 miles per day.  during the next fortnight this nation will entertain the nations of the world in a celebration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the first successful airplane flight. the credit for this epoch-making achievement belongs to a citizen of our own country, orville wright.  cuban parcel post  i desire to repeat my recommendation of an earlier message, that congress enact the legislation necessary to make permanent the parcel post convention with cuba, both as a facility to american commerce and as a measure of equity to cuba in the one class of goods which that country can send here by parcel post without detriment to our own trade.  \"maine\" battleship memorial  when i attended the pan american conference at habana, the president of cuba showed me a marble statue made from the original memorial that was overturned by a storm after it was erected on the cuban shore to the memory of the men who perished in the destruction of the battleship maine. as a testimony of friendship and appreciation of the cuban government and people lie most gen  erously offered to present this to the. united states, and i assured him of my pleasure in accepting it. there is no location in the white house for placing so large and heavy a structure, and i therefore urge the congress to provide by law for some locality where it can be set up.  railroads  in previous annual messages i have suggested the enactment of laws to promote railroad consolidation with the view of increasing the efficiency of transportation and lessening its cost to the public. while, consolidations can and should be made under the present law until it is changed, vet the provisions of the act of 1920 have not been found fully adequate to meet the needs of other methods of consolidation. amendments designed to remedy these defects have been considered at length by the respective committees of congress and a bill was reported out late in the last session which i understand has the approval in principle of the interstate commerce commission. it is to be hoped that this legislation may be enacted at an early date.  experience has shown that the interstate commerce law requires definition and clarification in several other respects, some of which have been pointed out by the interstate commerce commission in its annual reports to the congress. it will promote the public interest to have the congress give early consideration to the recommendations there made.  merchant marine  the cost of maintaining the united states government merchant fleet has been steadily reduced. we have established american flag lines in foreign trade where they had never before existed as a means of promoting commerce and as a naval auxiliary. there have been sold to private american capital for operation within the past few years 14 of these lines, which, under the encouragement of the recent legislation passed by the congress, give promise of continued successful operation. additional legislation from time to time may be necessary to promote future advancement under private control.  through the cooperation of the post office department and the shipping board long-term contracts are being made with american steamship lines for carrying mail, which already promise the construction of 15 to 20 new vessels and the gradual reestablishment of the american merchant marine as a private enterprise. no action of the national government has been so beneficial to our shipping. the cost is being absorbed to a considerable extent by the disposal of unprofitable lines operated by the shipping board, for which the new law has made a market. meanwhile it should be our policy to maintain necessary strategic lines under the government operation until they can be transferred to private capital.  inter-american highway  in my message last year i expressed the view that we should lend our encouragement for more good roads to all the principal points on this hemisphere south of the rio grande. my view has not changed.  the pan american union has recently indorsed it. in some of the countries to the south a great deal of progress is being made in road building. in, others engineering features are often exacting and financing difficult. as those countries enter upon programs for road building we should be ready to contribute from our abundant experience to make their task easier of accomplishment. i prefer not to go into civil life to accomplish this end. we already furnish military and naval advisors, and following this precedent we could draw competent men from these same sources and from the department of agriculture.  we should provide our southern neighbors, if they request it, with such engineer advisors for the construction of roads and bridges. private t1literests should look with favor upon all reasonable loans sought by these countries to open main lines of travel. such assistance should be given especially to any project for a highway designed to connect all the countries on this hemisphere and thus facilitate, intercourse and closer relations among, them.  air mail service  the friendly relations and the extensive, commercial intercourse with the western hemisphere to the south of us are being further cemented by the establishment and extension of air-mail routes. we shall soon have one from key west, fla., over cuba, haiti, and santo domingo to san juan, p. r., where it will connect with another route to trinidad. there will be another route from key west to the canal zone, where connection will be made with a route across the northern coast of south america to paramaribo. this will give us a circle around the caribbean under our own control.. additional connections will be made at colon with a route running down the west coast of south america as far as conception, chile, and with the french air mail at paramaribo running down the eastern coast of south america. \\'the air service already spans our continent, with laterals running to mexico and canada, and covering a daily flight of over 28,000 miles, with an average cargo of 15 000 pounds.  waterways  our river and harbor improvements are proceeding with vigor. in the past few years ave have increased the appropriation for this regular work $28,000,000, besides what. is to be expended on flood control. the total appropriation for this year was over $91,000,000. the ohio river is almost ready for opening; work on the missouri and other rivers is under way. in accordance with the mississippi flood law army engineers are making investigations and surveys on other streams throughout the country with a view to flood control, navigation, waterpower, and irrigation. our bar(re lines are being operated under generous appropriations, and negotiations are developing relative to the st. lawrence waterway. to secure the largest benefits from all these waterways joint rates must be established with the railroads, preferably by agreement, but otherwise as a result of congressional action.  we have recently passed several river and harbor bills. the work ordered by the congress not, yet completed, will cost about $243,  000,000, besides the hundreds of millions to be spent on the mississippi flood way. until we can see our way out of this expense no further river and harbor legislation should be passed, as expenditures to put it into effect would be four or five years away.  irrigation of arid lands  for many years the federal government has been committed to the wise policy of reclamation and irrigation. while it has met with some failures due to unwise selection of projects and lack of thorough soil surveys, so that they could not be placed on a sound business basis, on the whole the service has been of such incalculable benefit in so many states that no one would advocate its abandonment. the program to which we are already committed, providing for the construction of new projects authorized by congress and the completion of old projects, will tax the resources of the reclamation fund over a period of years. the high cost of improving and equipping farms adds to the difficulty of securing settlers for vacant farms on federal projects.  readjustments authorized by the reclamation relief act of may 25, 1926, have given more favorable terms of repayment to settlers. these new financial arrangements and the general prosperity on irrigation projects have resulted in increased collections by the department of the interior of charges due the reclamation fund. nevertheless, the demand for still smaller yearly payments on some projects continues. these conditions should have consideration in connection with any proposed new projects.  colorado river  for several years the congress has considered the erection of a dam on the colorado river for flood-control, irrigation, and domestic water purposes, all of which ma properly be considered as government functions. there would be an incidental creation of water power which could be used for generating electricity. as private enterprise can very well fill this field, there is no need for the government to go into it. it is unfortunate that the states interested in this water have been unable to agree among themselves. nevertheless, any legislation should give every possible safeguard to the present and prospective rights of each of them.  the congress will have before it, the detailed report of a special board appointed to consider the engineering and economic feasibility of this project. from the short summary which i have seen of it, 11 judge they consider the engineering problems can be met at somewhat increased cost over previous estimates. they prefer the black canyon site. on the economic features they are not so clear and appear to base their conclusions on many conditions which can not be established with certainty. so far as i can judge, however, from the summary, their conclusions appear sufficiently favorable, so that i feel warranted in recommending a measure which will protect the rights of the states, discharge the necessary government functions, and leave the electrical field to private. enterprise.  muscle shoals  the development of other methods of producing nitrates will probably render this plant less important for that purpose than formerly. but we have it, and i am told it still provides a practical method of making nitrates for national defense and farm fertilizers. by dividing the property into its two component parts of power and nitrate plants it would be possible to dispose of the power, reserving the right to any concern that wished to make nitrates to use any power that might be needed for that purpose. such a disposition of the power plant can be made that will return in rental about $2,000,000 per year. if the congress would giant the secretary of war authority to lease the nitrate plant on such terms as would insure the largest production of nitrates, the entire property could begin to  function. such a division, i am aware, has never seemed to appeal to the congress. i should also gladly approve a bill granting authority to lease the entire property for the production of nitrates.  i wish to avoid building another, (lam at public expense. future operators should provide for that themselves. but if they were to be required to repay the cost of such dam with tile prevailing commercial rates for interest, this difficulty will be considerably lessened. nor do i think this property should be made a vehicle for putting the united states government indiscriminately into the private and retail field of power distribution and nitrate sales.  conservation  the practical application of economy to the resources of the country calls for conservation. this does not mean that every resource should not be developed to its full degree, but it means that none of them should be wasted. we have a conservation board working on our oil problem. this is of the utmost importance to the future well-being of our people in this age of oil-burning engines and tile general application of gasoline to transportation. the secretary of the interior should not be compelled to lease oil lands of the osage indians when the market is depressed and the future supply is in jeopardy.  while the area of lands remaining in public ownership is small, compared with the vast area in private ownership, the natural resources of those in public ownership are of immense present and future value. this is particularly trite as to minerals and water power. the proper bureaus have been classifying these resources to the end that they may be conserved. appropriate estimates are being submitted, in the budget, for the further prosecution of this important work.  immigration  the policy of restrictive immigration should be maintained. authority should be granted the secretary of labor to give immediate preference to learned professions and experts essential to new industries. the reuniting of families should be expedited. our immigration and naturalization laws might well be codified.  wage earner  in its economic life our country has rejected the long accepted law of a limitation of the wage fund, which led to pessimism and despair because it was the doctrine of perpetual poverty, and has substituted for it the american conception that the only limit to profits and wages is production, which is the doctrine of optimism and hope because it leads to prosperity. here and there the councils of labor are still darkened by the theory that only by limiting individual production can there be any assurance of permanent employment for increasing numbers, but in general, management and wage earner alike have become emancipated from this doom and have entered a new era in industrial thought which has unleashed the productive capacity of the individual worker with an increasing scale of wages and profits, the end of which is not yet. the application of this theory accounts for our widening distribution of wealth. no discovery ever did more to increase the happiness and prosperity of the people.  since 1922 increasing production has increased wages in general 12.9 per cent, while in certain selected trades they have run as high as 34.9 per cent and 38 per cent. even in the boot and shoe shops the increase is over 5 per cent and in woolen mills 8.4 per cent, although these industries have not prospered like others. as the rise in living costs in this period is negligible, these figures represent real wage increases.  the cause of constructive economy requires that the government should cooperate with private interests to eliminate the waste arising from industrial accidents. this item, with all that has been done to reduce it, still reaches enormous proportions with great suffering to the workman and great loss to the country.  women and children  the federal government should continue its solicitous care for the 8,500,000 women wage earners and its efforts in behalf of public health, which is reducing infant mortality and improving the 91odily and mental condition of our citizens.  civil service  the most marked change made in the civil service of the government in the past eight years relates to the increase in salaries. the board of actuaries on the retirement act shows by its report, that july 1, 1921 the average salary of the 330,047 employees subject to the act was j1,307, while on june 30, 1927, the average salary of the corresponding, 405,263 was $1,969. this was an increase in six years of nearly 53 per cent. on top of this was the generous increase made at the last session of the congress generally applicable to federal employees and another bill increasing the pay in certain branches of the postal service beyond the large increase which was made three years ago. this raised the average level from $1,969 to $2,092, making an increase in seven years of over 63 per cent. while it is well known that in the upper brackets the pay in the federal  service is much smaller than in private employment, in the lower brackets, ranging well up over $3,000, it is much higher. it is higher not only in actual money paid, but in privileges granted, a vacation of 30 actual working days, or 5 weeks each year, with additional time running in some departments as high as 30 days for sick leave and the generous provisions of the retirement act. no other body of public servants ever occupied such a fortunate position.  education  through the bureau of education of the department of the interior the federal government, acting in an informative and advisory capacity, has rendered valuable service. while this province be7crigspeculiarly to the states, yet the promotion of education and efficiency in educational methods is a general responsibility of the federal government. a survey of negro colleges and universities in the united states has just been completed l7y the bureau of education through funds provided by the institutions themselves and through private sources. the present status of negro higher education was determined and recommendations were made for its advancement. this was one of the numerous cooperative undertakings of the bureau. following the invitation of the association of land grant colleges and universities, he bureau of education now has under way the survey of agricultural colleges, authorized by congress. the purpose of the survey is to ascertain the accomplishments, the status, and the future objectives of this type of educational training. it is now proposed to undertake a survey of secondary schools, which educators insist is timely and essential.  public buildings  we, have laid out a public building program for the district of columbia and the country at large runni110\\' into hundreds of millions of dollars. three important structures and one annex are already, under way and one addition has been completed in the city of washington. in the country sites have been acquired, many buildings are in course of construction, and some are already completed. plans for all this work are being prepared in order that it may be carried forward as rapidly as possible. this is the greatest building program ever assumed by this nation. it contemplates structures of utility and of beauty. when it reaches completion the people will be well served and the federal city will be supplied with the most beautiful and stately public buildings which adorn any capital in the world.  the american indian  the administration of indian affairs has been receiving intensive study for several years. the department of the interior has been able to provide better supervision of health, education, and industrial advancement of this native race through additional funds provided by the congress. the present cooperative arrangement existing between the bureau of indian affairs and the public health service should be extended. the government\\'s responsibility to the american indian has been acknowledged by annual increases in appropria.l  tions to fulfill its obligations to them and to hasten the time when federal supervision of their affairs may be properly and safely terminated. the movement in congress and in some of the state legislatures for extending responsibility in indian affairs to states should be encouraged. a complete participation by the indian in our economic life is the end to be desired.  the negro  for 65 years now our negro population has been under the peculiar care and solicitude of the national government. the progress which they have made in education and the professions, in wealth and in the arts of civilization, affords one of the most remarkable incidents in this period of world history. they have demonstrated their ability to partake of the advantages of our institutions and to benefit by a free and more and more independent existence. whatever doubt there may have been of their capacity to assume, the status granted to them by the constitution of this union is being rapidly dissipated. their cooperation in the life of the nation is constantly enlarging.  exploiting the negro problem for political ends is being abandoned and their protection is being increased by those states in which their percentage of population is largest. every encouragement should be extended for t le development of the race. the colored people have been the victims of the crime of lynching, which has in late years somewhat decreased. some parts of the south already have wholesome laws for its restraint and punishment. their example might well be followed by other states, and by such immediate remedial legislation as the federal government can extend under the constitution.  philippine islands  under the guidance of governor general stimson the economic and political conditions of the philippine islands have been raised to a standard never before surpassed. the cooperation between his administration and the people of the islands is complete and harmonious. it would be an advantage if relief from double taxation could be granted by the congress to our citizens doing business in the islands.  porto rico  due to the terrific storm that swept porto rico last september, the people of that island suffered large losses. the red cross and the war department went to their rescue. the property loss is being, retrieved. sugar, tobacco, citrus fruit, and coffee, all suffered damage. the first three can largely look after themselves. the coffee growers will need some assistance, which should be *extended strictly on a business basis, and only after most careful investigation. the people of porto rico are not asking for charity.  department of justice  it is desirable that all the legal activities of the government be consolidated under the supervision of the attorney general. in  1870 it was felt necessary to create the department of justice for this purpose. during the intervening period, either through legislation creating law officers or departmental action, additional legal positions not under the supervision of the attorney general have been provided until there are now over 900. such a condition is as harmful to the interest of the government now as it was in 1870, and should be corrected by appropriate legislation.  special government counsel  in order to prosecute the oil cases, i suggested and the congress enacted a law providing for the appointment of two special counsel. they have pursued their work with signal ability, recovering all the leased lands besides nearly $30,000,000 in money, and nearly $17,000,000 in other property. they find themselves hampered by a statute, which the attorney general construes as applying to them, prohibiting their appearing for private clients before any department. for this reason, one has been compelled to resign. no good result is secured by the application of this rule to these counsel, and as mr. roberts has consented to take reappointment if the rule is abrogated i recommend the passage of an amendment to the law creating their office exempting them from the general rule against taking other cases involving the government.  prohibition  the country has duly adopted the eighteenth amendment. those who object to it have the right to advocate its modification or repeal. meantime) it is binding upon the national and state governments and all our inhabitants. the federal enforcement bureau is making every effort to prevent violations, especially through smuggling, manufacture, and transportation, and to prosecute generally all violations for which it can secure evidence. it is bound to continue this policy. under the terms of the constitution, however, the obligation is equally on the states to exercise the power which they have through the executive, legislative. judicial, and police branches of their governments in behalf of enforcement. the federal government is doing and will continue to do all it can in this direction and is entitled to7the active cooperation of the states.  conclusion  the country is in the midst of an era of prosperity more extensive and of peace more permanent than it has ever before experienced. but, having reached this position, we should not fail to comprehend that it can easily be lost. it needs more effort for its support than the less exalted places of the world. we shall not be permitted to take our case, but shall continue to be required to spend our days in unremitting toil. the actions of the government must command the confidence of the country. without this, our prosperity would be lost. we must extend to other countries the largest measure of generosity, moderation, and patience. in addition to dealing justly, we can well afford to walk humbly.  the end of government is to keep open the opportunity for a more  abundant life. peace and prosperity are not finalities; they are only methods. it is too easy under their influence for a nation to become selfish and degenerate. this test has come to the united states. our country has been provided with the resources with which it can enlarge its intellectual, moral, and spiritual life. the issue is in the hands of the people. our faith in man and god is the justification for the belief in our continuing success.'\n",
      " \"to the senate and house of representatives: i have the honor to comply with the requirement of the constitution that i should lay before the congress information as to the state of the union, and recommend consideration of such measures as are necessary and expedient. substantial progress has been made during the year in national peace and security; the fundamental strength of the nation's economic life is unimpaired; education and scientific discovery have made advances; our country is more alive to its problems of moral and spiritual welfare. economic situation during the past 12 months we have suffered with other nations from economic depression. the origins of this depression lie to some extent within our own borders through a speculative period which diverted capital and energy into speculation rather than constructive enterprise. had overspeculation in securities been the only force operating, we should have seen recovery many months ago, as these particular dislocations have generally readjusted themselves. other deep-seated causes have been in action, however, chiefly the world-wide overproduction beyond even the demand of prosperous times for such important basic commodities as wheat, rubber, coffee, sugar, copper, silver, zinc, to some extent cotton, and other raw materials. the cumulative effects of demoralizing price falls of these important commodities in the process of adjustment of production to world consumption have produced financial crises in many countries and have diminished the buying power of these countries for imported goods to a degree which extended the difficulties farther afield by creating unemployment in all the industrial nations. the political agitation in asia; revolutions in south america and political unrest in some european states; the methods of sale by russia of her increasing agricultural exports to european markets; and our own drought—have all contributed to prolong and deepen the depression. in the larger view the major forces of the depression now lie outside of the united states, and our recuperation has been retarded by the unwarranted degree of fear and apprehension created by these outside forces. the extent of the depression is indicated by the following approximate percentages of activity during the past three months as compared with the highly prosperous year of 1928:various other indexes indicate total decrease of activity from 1928 of from 15 to 20 per cent. there are many factors which give encouragement for the future. the fact that we are holding from 80 to 85 per cent of our normal activities and incomes; that our major financial and industrial institutions have come through the storm unimpaired; that price levels of major commodities have remained approximately stable for some time; that a number of industries are showing signs of increasing demand; that the world at large is readjusting itself to the situation; all reflect grounds for confidence. we should remember that these occasions have been met many times before, that they are but temporary, that our country is to-day stronger and richer in resources, in equipment, in skill, than ever in its history. we are in an extraordinary degree self-sustaining, we will overcome world influences and will lead the march of prosperity as we have always done hitherto. economic depression can not be cured by legislative action or executive pronouncement. economic wounds must be healed by the action of the cells of the economic body—the producers and consumers themselves. recovery can be expedited and its effects mitigated by cooperative action. that cooperation requires that every individual should sustain faith and courage; that each should maintain his self-reliance; that each and every one should search for methods of improving his business or service; that the vast majority whose income is unimpaired should not hoard out of fear but should pursue their normal living and recreations; that each should seek to assist his neighbors who may be less fortunate; that each industry should assist its own employees; that each community and each state should assume its full responsibilities for organization of employment and relief of distress with that sturdiness and independence which built a great nation. our people are responding to these impulses in remarkable degree. the best contribution of government lies in encouragement of this voluntary cooperation in the community. the government, national, state, and local, can join with the community in such programs and do its part. a year ago i, together with other officers of the government, initiated extensive cooperative measures throughout the country. the first of these measures was an agreement of leading employers to maintain the standards of wages and of labor leaders to use their influence against strife. in a large sense these undertakings have been adhered to and we have not witnessed the usual reductions of wages which have always heretofore marked depressions. the index of union wage scales shows them to be today fully up to the level of any of the previous three years. in consequence the buying power of the country has been much larger than would otherwise have been the case. of equal importance the nation has had unusual peace in industry and freedom from the public disorder which has characterized previous depressions. the second direction of cooperation has been that our governments, national, state, and local, the industries and business so distribute employment as to give work to the maximum number of employees. the third direction of cooperation has been to maintain and even extend construction work and betterments in anticipation of the future. it has been the universal experience in previous depressions that public works and private construction have fallen off rapidly with the general tide of depression. on this occasion, however, the increased authorization and generous appropriations by the congress and the action of states and municipalities have resulted in the expansion of public construction to an amount even above that in the most prosperous years. in addition the cooperation of public utilities, railways, and other large organizations has been generously given in construction and betterment work in anticipation of future need. the department of commerce advises me that as a result, the volume of this type of construction work, which amounted to roughly $6,300,000,000 in 1929, instead of decreasing will show a total of about $7,000,000,000 for 1930. there has, of course, been a substantial decrease in the types of construction which could not be undertaken in advance of need. the fourth direction of cooperation was the organization in such states and municipalities, as was deemed necessary, of committees to organize local employment, to provide for employment agencies, and to effect relief of distress. the result of magnificent cooperation throughout the country has been that actual suffering has been kept to a minimum during the past 12 months, and our unemployment has been far less in proportion than in other large industrial countries. some time ago it became evident that unemployment would continue over the winter and would necessarily be added to from seasonal causes and that the savings of workpeople would be more largely depleted. we have as a nation a definite duty to see that no deserving person in our country suffers from hunger or cold. i therefore set up a more extensive organization to stimulate more intensive cooperation throughout the country. there has been a most gratifying degree of response, from governors, mayors, and other public officials, from welfare organizations, and from employers in concerns both large and small. the local communities through their voluntary agencies have assumed the duty of relieving individual distress and are being generously supported by the public. the number of those wholly out of employment seeking for work was accurately determined by the census last april as about 2,500,000. the department of labor index of employment in the larger trades shows some decrease in employment since that time. the problem from a relief point of view is somewhat less than the published estimates of the number of unemployed would indicate. the intensive community and individual efforts in providing special employment outside the listed industries are not reflected in the statistical indexes and tend to reduce such published figures. moreover, there is estimated to be a constant figure at all times of nearly 1,000,000 unemployed who are not without annual income but temporarily idle in the shift from one job to another. we have an average of about three breadwinners to each two families, so that every person unemployed does not represent a family without income. the view that the relief problems are less than the gross numbers would indicate is confirmed by the experience of several cities, which shows that the number of families in distress represents from 10 to 20 per cent of the number of the calculated unemployed. this is not said to minimize the very real problem which exists but to weigh its actual proportions. as a contribution to the situation the federal government is engaged upon the greatest program of waterway, harbor, flood control, public building, highway, and airway improvement in all our history. this, together with loans to merchant shipbuilders, improvement of the navy and in military aviation, and other construction work of the government will exceed $520,000,000 for this fiscal year. this compares with $253,000,000 in the fiscal year 1928. the construction works already authorized and the continuation of policies in government aid will require a continual expenditure upwards of half a billion dollars annually.i favor still further temporary expansion of these activities in aid to unemployment during this winter. the congress will, however, have presented to it numbers of projects, some of them under the guise of, rather than the reality of, their usefulness in the increase of employment during the depression. there are certain commonsense limitations upon any expansions of construction work. the government must not undertake works that are not of sound economic purpose and that have not been subject to searching technical investigation, and which have not been given adequate consideration by the congress. the volume of construction work in the government is already at the maximum limit warranted by financial prudence as a continuing policy. to increase taxation for purposes of construction work defeats its own purpose, as such taxes directly diminish employment in private industry. again any kind of construction requires, after its authorization, a considerable time before labor can be employed in which to make engineering, architectural, and legal preparations. our immediate problem is the increase of employment for the next six months, and new plans which do not produce such immediate result or which extend commitments beyond this period are not warranted. the enlarged rivers and harbors, public building, and highway plans authorized by the congress last session, however, offer an opportunity for assistance by the temporary acceleration of construction of these programs even faster than originally planned, especially if the technical requirements of the laws which entail great delays could be amended in such fashion as to speed up acquirements of land and the letting of contracts. with view, however, to the possible need for acceleration, we, immediately upon receiving those authorities from the congress five months ago, began the necessary technical work in preparation for such possible eventuality. i have canvassed the departments of the government as to the maximum amount that can be properly added to our present expenditure to accelerate all construction during the next six months, and i feel warranted in asking the congress for an appropriation of from $100,000,000 to $150,000,000 to provide such further employment in this emergency. in connection therewith we need some authority to make enlarged temporary advances of federal-highway aid to the states. i recommend that this appropriation be made distributable to the different departments upon recommendation of a committee of the cabinet and approval by the president. its application to works already authorized by the congress assures its use in directions of economic importance and to public welfare. such action will imply an expenditure upon construction of all kinds of over $650,000,000 during the next twelve months. agriculture the world-wide depression has affected agriculture in common with all other industries. the average price of farm produce has fallen to about 80 per cent of the levels of 1928. this average is, however, greatly affected by wheat and cotton, which have participated in world-wide overproduction and have fallen to about 60 per cent of the average price of the year 1928. excluding these commodities, the prices of all other agricultural products are about 84 per cent of those of 1928. the average wholesale prices of other primary goods, such as nonferrous metals, have fallen to 76 per cent of 1928. the price levels of our major agricultural commodities are, in fact, higher than those in other principal producing countries, due to the combined result of the tariff and the operations of the farm board. for instance, wheat prices at minneapolis are about 30 per cent higher than at winnipeg, and at chicago they are about 20 per cent higher than at buenos aires. corn prices at chicago are over twice as high as at buenos aires. wool prices average more than 80 per cent higher in this country than abroad, and butter is 30 per cent higher in new york city than in copenhagen. aside from the misfortune to agriculture of the world-wide depression we have had the most severe drought. it has affected particularly the states bordering on the potomac, ohio, and lower mississippi rivers, with some areas in montana, kansas, oklahoma, and texas. it has found its major expression in the shortage of pasturage and a shrinkage in the corn crop from an average of about 2,800,000,000 bushels to about 2,090,000,000 bushels. on august 14 i called a conference of the governors of the most acutely affected states, and as a result of its conclusions i appointed a national committee comprising the heads of the important federal agencies under the chairmanship of the secretary of agriculture. the governors in turn have appointed state committees representative of the farmers, bankers, business men, and the red cross, and subsidiary committees have been established in most of the acutely affected counties. railway rates were reduced on feed and livestock in and out of the drought areas, and over 50,000 cars of such products have been transported under these reduced rates. the red cross established a preliminary fund of $5,000,000 for distress relief purposes and established agencies for its administration in each county. of this fund less than $500,000 has been called for up to this time as the need will appear more largely during the winter. the federal farm loan board has extended its credit facilities, and the federal farm board has given financial assistance to all affected cooperatives. in order that the government may meet its full obligation toward our countrymen in distress through no fault of their own, i recommend that an appropriation should be made to the department of agriculture to be loaned for the purpose of seed and feed for animals. its application should as hitherto in such loans be limited to a gross amount to any one individual, and secured upon the crop. the red cross can relieve the cases of individual distress by the sympathetic assistance of our people. finances of the government i shall submit the detailed financial position of the government with recommendations in the usual budget message. i will at this time, however, mention that the budget estimates of receipts and expenditures for the current year were formulated by the treasury and the budget bureau at a time when it was impossible to forecast the severity of the business depression and have been most seriously affected by it. at that time a surplus of about $123,000,000 was estimated for this fiscal year and tax reduction which affected the fiscal year to the extent of $75,000,000 was authorized by the congress, thus reducing the estimated surplus to about $48,000,000. closely revised estimates now made by the treasury and the bureau of the budget of the tax, postal, and other receipts for the current fiscal year indicate a decrease of about $430,000,000 from the estimate of a year ago, of which about $75,000,000 is due to tax reduction, leaving about $355,000,000 due to the depression. moreover, legislation enacted by congress subsequent to the submission of the budget enlarging federal construction work to expand employment and for increase in veterans' services and other items, have increased expenditures during the current fiscal year by about $225,000,000. thus the decrease of $430,000,000 in revenue and the increase of $225,000,000 in expenditure adversely change the original budget situation by about $655,000,000. this large sum is offset by the original estimated surplus a year ago of about $123,000,000, by the application of $185,000,000 of interest payments upon the foreign debt to current expenditures, by arrangements of the farm board through repayments, etc., in consequence of which they reduced their net cash demands upon the treasury by $100,000,000 in this period, and by about $67,000,000 economies and deferments brought about in the government, thus reducing the practical effect of the change in the situation to an estimated deficit of about $180,000,000 for the present fiscal year. i shall make suggestions for handling the present-year deficit in the budget message, but i do not favor encroachment upon the statutory reduction of the public debt. while it will be necessary in public interest to further increase expenditures during the current fiscal year in aid to unemployment by speeding up construction work and aid to the farmers affected by the drought, i can not emphasize too strongly the absolute necessity to defer any other plans for increase of government expenditures. the budget for 1932 fiscal year indicates estimated expenditure of about $4,054,000,000, including postal deficit. the receipts are estimated at about $4,085,000,000 if the temporary tax reduction of last year be discontinued, leaving a surplus of only about $30,000,000. most rigid economy is therefore necessary to avoid increase in taxes. national defense our army and navy are being maintained at a high state of efficiency, under officers of high training and intelligence, supported by a devoted personnel of the rank and file. the london naval treaty has brought important economies in the conduct of the navy. the navy department will lay before the committees of the congress recommendations for a program of authorization of new construction which should be initiated in the fiscal year of 1932. legislation this is the last session of the seventy-first congress. during its previous sittings it has completed a very large amount of important legislation, notably: the establishment of the federal farm board; fixing congressional reapportionment; revision of the tariff, including the flexible provisions and a reorganization of the tariff commission; reorganization of the radio commission; reorganization of the federal power commission; expansion of federal prisons; reorganization of parole and probation system in federal prisons; expansion of veterans' hospitals; establishment of disability allowances to veterans; consolidation of veteran activities; consolidation and strengthening of prohibition enforcement activities in the department of justice; organization of a narcotics bureau; large expansion of rivers and harbors improvements; substantial increase in federal highways; enlargement of public buildings construction program; and the ratification of the london naval treaty. the congress has before it legislation partially completed in the last sitting in respect to muscle shoals, bus regulation, relief of congestion in the courts, reorganization of border patrol in prevention of smuggling, law enforcement in the district of columbia, and other subjects. it is desirable that these measures should be completed. the short session does not permit of extensive legislative programs, but there are a number of questions which, if time does not permit action, i recommend should be placed in consideration by the congress, perhaps through committees cooperating in some instances with the federal departments, with view to preparation for subsequent action. among them are the following subjects: electrical power i have in a previous message recommended effective regulation of interstate electrical power. such regulation should preserve the independence and responsibility of the states. railways we have determined upon a national policy of consolidation of the railways as a necessity of more stable and more economically operated transportation. further legislation is necessary to facilitate such consolidation. in the public interest we should strengthen the railways that they may meet our future needs. antitrust laws i recommend that the congress institute an inquiry into some aspects of the economic working of these laws. i do not favor repeal of the sherman act. the prevention of monopolies is of most vital public importance. competition is not only the basis of protection to the consumer but is the incentive to progress. however, the interpretation of these laws by the courts, the changes in business, especially in the economic effects upon those enterprises closely related to the use of the natural resources of the country, make such an inquiry advisable. the producers of these materials assert that certain unfortunate results of wasteful and destructive use of these natural resources together with a destructive competition which impoverishes both operator and worker can not be remedied because of the prohibitive interpretation of the antitrust laws. the well-known condition of the bituminous coal industry is an illustration. the people have a vital interest in the conservation of their natural resources; in the prevention of wasteful practices; in conditions of destructive competition which may impoverish the producer and the wage earner; and they have an equal interest in maintaining adequate competition. i therefore suggest that an inquiry be directed especially to the effect of the workings of the antitrust laws in these particular fields to determine if these evils can be remedied without sacrifice of the fundamental purpose of these laws. capital-gains tax it is urged by many thoughtful citizens that the peculiar economic effect of the income tax on so-called capital gains at the present rate is to enhance speculative inflation and likewise impede business recovery. i believe this to be the case and i recommend that a study be made of the economic effects of this tax and of its relation to the general structure of our income tax law. immigration there is need for revision of our immigration laws upon a more limited and more selective basis, flexible to the needs of the country. under conditions of current unemployment it is obvious that persons coming to the united states seeking work would likely become either a direct or indirect public charge. as a temporary measure the officers issuing visas to immigrants have been, in pursuance of the law, instructed to refuse visas to applicants likely to fall into this class. as a result the visas issued have decreased from an average of about 24,000 per month prior to restrictions to a rate of about 7,000 during the last month. these are largely preferred persons under the law. visas from mexico are about 250 per month compared to about 4,000 previous to restrictions. the whole subject requires exhaustive reconsideration. deportation of alien criminals i urge the strengthening of our deportation laws so as to more fully rid ourselves of criminal aliens. furthermore, thousands of persons have entered the country in violation of the immigration laws. the very method of their entry indicates their objectionable character, and our law-abiding foreign-born residents suffer in consequence. i recommend that the congress provide methods of strengthening the government to correct this abuse. post office due to deferment of government building over many years, previous administrations had been compelled to enter upon types of leases for secondary facilities in large cities, some of which were objectionable as representing too high a return upon the value of the property. to prevent the occasion for further uneconomic leasing i recommend that the congress authorize the building by the government of its own facilities. veterans the nation has generously expanded its care for veterans. the consolidation of all veterans' activities into the veterans' administration has produced substantial administrative economies. the consolidation also brings emphasis to the inequalities in service and allowances. the whole subject is under study by the administrator, and i recommend it should also be examined by the committees of the congress. social service i urge further consideration by the congress of the recommendations i made a year ago looking to the development through temporary federal aid of adequate state and local services for the health of children and the further stamping out of communicable disease, particularly in the rural sections. the advance of scientific discovery, methods, and social thought imposes a new vision in these matters. the drain upon the federal treasury is comparatively small. the results both economic and moral are of the utmost importance. general it is my belief that after the passing of this depression, when we can examine it in retrospect, we shall need to consider a number of other questions as to what action may be taken by the government to remove possible governmental influences which make for instability and to better organize mitigation of the effect of depression. it is as yet too soon to constructively formulate such measures. there are many administrative subjects, such as departmental reorganization, extension of the civil service, readjustment of the postal rates, etc., which at some appropriate time require the attention of the congress. foreign relations our relations with foreign countries have been maintained upon a high basis of cordiality and good will. during the past year the london naval pact was completed, approved by the senate, and ratified by the governments concerned. by this treaty we have abolished competition in the building of warships, have established the basis of parity of the united states with the strongest of foreign powers, and have accomplished a substantial reduction in war vessels. during the year there has been an extended political unrest in the world. asia continues in disturbed condition, and revolutions have taken place in brazil, argentina, peru, and bolivia. despite the jeopardy to our citizens and their property which naturally arises in such circumstances, we have, with the cooperation of the governments concerned, been able to meet all such instances without friction. we have resumed normal relations with the new governments of brazil, argentina, peru, and bolivia immediately upon evidence that they were able to give protection to our citizens and their property, and that they recognized their international obligations. a commission which was supported by the congress has completed its investigation and reported upon our future policies in respect to haiti and proved of high value in securing the acceptance of these policies. an election has been held and a new government established. we have replaced our high commissioner by a minister and have begun the gradual withdrawal of our activities with view to complete retirement at the expiration of the present treaty in 1935. a number of arbitration and conciliation treaties have been completed or negotiated during the year, and will be presented for approval by the senate. i shall, in a special message, lay before the senate the protocols covering the statutes of the world court which have been revised to accord with the sense of previous senate reservations.\"\n",
      " 'to the senate and house of representatives: it is my duty under the constitution to transmit to the congress information on the state of the union and to recommend for its consideration necessary and expedient measures. the chief influence affecting the state of the union during the past year has been the continued world-wide economic disturbance. our national concern has been to meet the emergencies it has created for us and to lay the foundations for recovery. if we lift our vision beyond these immediate emergencies we find fundamental national gains even amid depression. in meeting the problems of this difficult period, we have witnessed a remarkable development of the sense of cooperation in the community. for the first time in the history of our major economic depressions there has been a notable absence of public disorders and industrial conflict. above all there is an enlargement of social and spiritual responsibility among the people. the strains and stresses upon business have resulted in closer application, in saner policies, and in better methods. public improvements have been carried out on a larger scale than even in normal times. the country is richer in physical property, in newly discovered resources, and in productive capacity than ever before. there has been constant gain in knowledge and education; there has been continuous advance in science and invention; there has been distinct gain in public health. business depressions have been recurrent in the life of our country and are but transitory. the nation has emerged from each of them with increased strength and virility because of the enlightenment they have brought, the readjustments and the larger understanding of the realities and obligations of life and work which come from them. national defense both our army and navy have been maintained in a high state of efficiency. the ability and devotion of both officers and men sustain the highest traditions of the service. reductions and postponements in expenditure of these departments to meet the present emergency are being made without reducing existing personnel or impairing the morale of either establishment. the agreement between the leading naval powers for limitation of naval armaments and establishment of their relative strength and thus elimination of competitive building also implies for ourselves the gradual expansion of the deficient categories in our navy to the parities provided in those treaties. however, none of the other nations, parties to these agreements, is to-day maintaining the full rate of construction which the treaty size of fleets would imply. although these agreements secured the maximum reduction of fleets which it was at that time possible to attain, i am hopeful that the naval powers, party to these agreements, will realize that establishment of relative strength in itself offers opportunity for further reduction without injury to any of them. this would be the more possible if pending negotiations are successful between france and italy. if the world is to regain its standards of life, it must further decrease both naval and other arms. the subject will come before the general disarmament conference which meets in geneva on february 2 foreign affairs we are at peace with the world. we have cooperated with other nations to preserve peace. the rights of our citizens abroad have been protected. the economic depression has continued and deepened in every part of the world during the past year. in many countries political instability, excessive armaments, debts, governmental expenditures, and taxes have resulted in revolutions, in unbalanced budgets and monetary collapse and financial panics, in dumping of goods upon world markets, and in diminished consumption of commodities. within two years there have been revolutions or acute social disorders in 19 countries, embracing more than half the population of the world. ten countries have been unable to meet their external obligations. in 14 countries, embracing a quarter of the world\\'s population, former monetary standards have been temporarily abandoned. in a number of countries there have been acute financial panics or compulsory restraints upon banking. these disturbances have many roots in the dislocations from the world war. every one of them has reacted upon us. they have sharply affected the markets and prices of our agricultural and industrial products. they have increased unemployment and greatly embarrassed our financial and credit system. as our difficulties during the past year have plainly originated in large degree from these sources, any effort to bring about our own recuperation has dictated the necessity of cooperation by us with other nations in reasonable effort to restore world confidence and economic stability. cooperation of our federal reserve system and our banks with the central banks in foreign countries has contributed to localize and ameliorate a number of serious financial crises or moderate the pressures upon us and thus avert disasters which would have affected us. the economic crisis in germany and central europe last june rose to the dimensions of a general panic from which it was apparent that without assistance these nations must collapse. apprehensions of such collapse had demoralized our agricultural and security markets and so threatened other nations as to impose further dangers upon us. but of highest importance was the necessity of cooperation on our part to relieve the people of germany from imminent disasters and to maintain their important relations to progress and stability in the world. upon the initiative of this government a year\\'s postponement of reparations and other intergovernmental debts was brought about. upon our further initiative an agreement was made by germany\\'s private creditors providing for an extension of such credits until the german people can develop more permanent and definite forms of relief. we have continued our policy of withdrawing our marines from haiti and nicaragua. the difficulties between china and japan have given us great concern, not alone for the maintenance of the spirit of the kellogg-briand pact, but for the maintenance of the treaties to which we are a party assuring the territorial integrity of china. it is our purpose to assist in finding solutions sustaining the full spirit of those treaties.i shall deal at greater length with our foreign relations in a later message. the domestic situation many undertakings have been organized and forwarded during the past year to meet the new and changing emergencies which have constantly confronted us. broadly the community has cooperated to meet the needs of honest distress, and to take such emergency measures as would sustain confidence in our financial system and would cushion the violence of liquidation in industry and commerce, thus giving time for orderly readjustment of costs, inventories, and credits without panic and widespread bankruptcy. these measures have served those purposes and will promote recovery. in these measures we have striven to mobilize and stimulate private initiative and local and community responsibility. there has been the least possible government entry into the economic field, and that only in temporary and emergency form. our citizens and our local governments have given a magnificent display of unity and action, initiative and patriotism in solving a multitude of difficulties and in cooperating with the federal government. for a proper understanding of my recommendations to the congress it is desirable very briefly to review such activities during the past year. the emergencies of unemployment have been met by action in many directions. the appropriations for the continued speeding up of the great federal construction program have provided direct and indirect aid to employment upon a large scale. by organized unity of action, the states and municipalities have also maintained large programs of public improvement. many industries have been prevailed upon to anticipate and intensify construction. industrial concerns and other employers have been organized to spread available work amongst all their employees, instead of discharging a portion of them. a large majority have maintained wages at as high levels as the safe conduct of their business would permit. this course has saved us from industrial conflict and disorder which have characterized all previous depressions. immigration has been curtailed by administrative action. upon the basis of normal immigration the decrease amounts to about 300,000 individuals who otherwise would have been added to our unemployment. the expansion of federal employment agencies under appropriations by the congress has proved most effective. through the president\\'s organization for unemployment relief, public and private agencies were successfully mobilized last winter to provide employment and other measures against distress. similar organization gives assurance against suffering during the coming winter. committees of leading citizens are now active at practically every point of unemployment. in the large majority they have been assured the funds necessary which, together with local government aids, will meet the situation. a few exceptional localities will be further organized. the evidence of the public health service shows an actual decrease of sickness and infant and general mortality below normal years. no greater proof could be adduced that our people have been protected from hunger and cold and that the sense of social responsibility in the nation has responded to the need of the unfortunate.to meet the emergencies in agriculture the loans authorized by congress for rehabilitation in the drought areas have enabled farmers to produce abundant crops in those districts. the red cross undertook and magnificently administered relief for over 2,500,000 drought sufferers last winter. it has undertaken this year to administer relief to 100,000 sufferers in the new drought area of certain northwest states. the action of the federal farm board in granting credits to farm cooperatives saved many of them from bankruptcy and increased their purpose and strength. by enabling farm cooperatives to cushion the fall in prices of farm products in 1930 and 1931 the board secured higher prices to the farmer than would have been obtained otherwise, although the benefits of this action were partially defeated by continued world overproduction. incident to this action the failure of a large number of farmers and of country banks was averted which could quite possibly have spread into a major disaster. the banks in the south have cooperated with the farm board in creation of a pool for the better marketing of accumulated cotton. growers have been materially assisted by this action. constant effort has been made to reduce overproduction in relief of agriculture and to promote the foreign buying of agricultural products by sustaining economic stability abroad. to meet our domestic emergencies in credit and banking arising from the reaction to acute crisis abroad the national credit association was set up by the banks with resources of $500,000,000 to support sound banks against the frightened withdrawals and hoarding. it is giving aid to reopen solvent banks which have been closed. federal officials have brought about many beneficial unions of banks and have employed other means which have prevented many bank closings. as a result of these measures the hoarding withdrawals which had risen to over $250,000,000 per week after the british crisis have substantially ceased. further measures the major economic forces and weaknesses at home and abroad have now been exposed and can be appraised, and the time is ripe for forward action to expedite our recovery. although some of the causes of our depression are due to speculation, inflation of securities and real estate, unsound foreign investments, and mismanagement of financial institutions, yet our self-contained national economy, with its matchless strength and resources, would have enabled us to recover long since but for the continued dislocations, shocks, and setbacks from abroad. whatever the causes may be, the vast liquidation and readjustments which have taken place have left us with a large degree of credit paralysis, which together with the situation in our railways and the conditions abroad, are now the outstanding obstacles to recuperation. if we can put our financial resources to work and can ameliorate the financial situation in the railways, i am confident we can make a large measure of recovery independent of the rest of the world. a strong america is the highest contribution to world stability. one phase of the credit situation is indicated in the banks. during the past year banks, representing 3 per cent of our total deposits have been closed. a large part of these failures have been caused by withdrawals for hoarding, as distinguished from the failures early in the depression where weakness due to mismanagement was the larger cause of failure. despite their closing, many of them will pay in full. although such withdrawals have practically ceased, yet $1,100,000,000 of currency was previously withdrawn which has still to return to circulation. this represents a large reduction of the ability of our banks to extend credit which would otherwise fertilize industry and agriculture. furthermore, many of our bankers, in order to prepare themselves to meet possible withdrawals, have felt compelled to call in loans, to refuse new credits, and to realize upon securities, which in turn has demoralized the markets. the paralysis has been further augmented by the steady increase in recent years of the proportion of bank assets invested in long-term securities, such as mortgages and bonds. these securities tend to lose their liquidity in depression or temporarily to fall in value so that the ability of the banks to meet the shock of sudden withdrawal is greatly lessened and the restriction of all kinds of credit is thereby increased. the continuing credit paralysis has operated to accentuate the deflation and liquidation of commodities, real estate, and securities below any reasonable basis of values. all of this tends to stifle business, especially the smaller units, and finally expresses itself in further depression of prices and values, in restriction on new enterprise, and in increased unemployment. the situation largely arises from an unjustified lack of confidence. we have enormous volumes of idle money in the banks and in hoarding. we do not require more money or working capital—we need to put what we have to work. the fundamental difficulties which have brought about financial strains in foreign countries do not exist in the united states. no external drain on our resources can threaten our position, because the balance of international payments is in our favor; we owe less to foreign countries than they owe to us; our industries are efficiently organized; our currency and bank deposits are protected by the greatest gold reserve in history. our first step toward recovery is to reestablish confidence and thus restore the flow of credit which is the very basis of our economic life. we must put some steel beams in the foundations of our credit structure. it is our duty to apply the full strength of our government not only to the immediate phases, but to provide security against shocks and the repetition of the weaknesses which have been proven. the recommendations which i here lay before the congress are designed to meet these needs by strengthening financial, industrial, and agricultural life through the medium of our existing institutions, and thus to avoid the entry of the government into competition with private business. federal government finance the first requirement of confidence and of economic recovery is financial stability of the united states government. i shall deal with fiscal questions at greater length in the budget message. but i must at this time call attention to the magnitude of the deficits which have developed and the resulting necessity for determined and courageous policies. these deficits arise in the main from the heavy decrease in tax receipts due to the depression and to the increase in expenditure on construction in aid to unemployment, aids to agriculture, and upon services to veterans. during the fiscal year ending june 30 last we incurred a deficit of about $903,000,000, which included the statutory reduction of the debt and represented an increase of the national debt by $616,000,000. of this, however, $153,000,000 is offset by increased cash balances. in comparison with the fiscal year 1928 there is indicated a fall in federal receipts for the present fiscal year amounting to $1,683,000,000, of which $1,034,000,000 is in individual and corporate income taxes alone. during this fiscal year there will be an increased expenditure, as compared to 1928, on veterans of $255,000,000, and an increased expenditure on construction work which may reach $520,000,000. despite large economies in other directions, we have an indicated deficit, including the statutory retirement of the debt, of $2,123,000,000, and an indicated net debt increase of about $1,711,000,000. the budget for the fiscal year beginning july 1 next, after allowing for some increase of taxes under the present laws and after allowing for drastic reduction in expenditures, still indicates a deficit of $1,417,000,000. after offsetting the statutory debt retirements this would indicate an increase in the national debt for the fiscal year 1933 of about $921,000,000. several conclusions are inevitable. we must have insistent and determined reduction in government expenses. we must face a temporary increase in taxes. such increase should not cover the whole of these deficits or it will retard recovery. we must partially finance the deficit by borrowing. it is my view that the amount of taxation should be fixed so as to balance the budget for 1933 except for the statutory debt retirement. such government receipts would assure the balance of the following year\\'s budget including debt retirement. it is my further view that the additional taxation should be imposed solely as an emergency measure terminating definitely two years from july 1 next. such a basis will give confidence in the determination of the government to stabilize its finance and will assure taxpayers of its temporary character. even with increased taxation, the government will reach the utmost safe limit of its borrowing capacity by the expenditures for which we are already obligated and the recommendations here proposed. to go further than these limits in either expenditures, taxes, or borrowing will destroy confidence, denude commerce and industry of its resources, jeopardize the financial system, and actually extend unemployment and demoralize agriculture rather than relieve it. federal land banks i recommend that the congress authorize the subscription by the treasury of further capital to the federal land banks to be retired as provided in the original act, or when funds are available, and that repayments of such capital be treated as a fund available for further subscriptions in the same manner. it is urgent that the banks be supported so as to stabilize the market values of their bonds and thus secure capital for the farmers at low rates, that they may continue their services to agriculture and that they may meet the present situation with consideration to the farmers. deposits in closed banks a method should be devised to make available quickly to depositors some portion of their deposits in closed banks as the assets of such banks may warrant. such provision would go far to relieve distress in a multitude of families, would stabilize values in many communities, and would liberate working capital to thousands of concerns. i recommend that measures be enacted promptly to accomplish these results and i suggest that the congress should consider the development of such a plan through the federal reserve banks. home-loan discount banks i recommend the establishment of a system of home-loan discount banks as the necessary companion in our financial structure of the federal reserve banks and our federal land banks. such action will relieve present distressing pressures against home and farm property owners. it will relieve pressures upon and give added strength to building and loan associations, savings banks, and deposit banks, engaged in extending such credits. such action would further decentralize our credit structure. it would revive residential construction and employment. it would enable such loaning institutions more effectually to promote home ownership. i discussed this plan at some length in a statement made public november 14, last. this plan has been warmly indorsed by the recent national conference upon home ownership and housing, whose members were designated by the governors of the states and the groups interested. reconstruction finance corporation in order that the public may be absolutely assured and that the government may be in position to meet any public necessity, i recommend that an emergency reconstruction corporation of the nature of the former war finance corporation should be established. it may not be necessary to use such an instrumentality very extensively. the very existence of such a bulwark will strengthen confidence. the treasury should be authorized to subscribe a reasonable capital to it, and it should be given authority to issue its own debentures. it should be placed in liquidation at the end of two years. its purpose is that by strengthening the weak spots to thus liberate the full strength of the nation\\'s resources. it should be in position to facilitate exports by american agencies; make advances to agricultural credit agencies where necessary to protect and aid the agricultural industry; to make temporary advances upon proper securities to established industries, railways, and financial institutions which can not otherwise secure credit, and where such advances will protect the credit structure and stimulate employment. its functions would not overlap those of the national credit corporation. federal reserve eligibility on october 6th i issued a statement that i should recommend to the congress an extension during emergencies of the eligibility provisions in the federal reserve act. this statement was approved by a representative gathering of the members of both houses of the congress, including members of the appropriate committees. it was approved by the officials of the treasury department, and i understand such an extension has been approved by a majority of the governors of the federal reserve banks. nothing should be done which would lower the safeguards of the system. the establishment of the mortgage-discount banks herein referred to will also contribute to further reserve strength in the banks without inflation. banking laws our people have a right to a banking system in which their deposits shall be safeguarded and the flow of credit less subject to storms. the need of a sounder system is plainly shown by the extent of bank failures. i recommend the prompt improvement of the banking laws. changed financial conditions and commercial practices must be met. the congress should investigate the need for separation between different kinds of banking; an enlargement of branch banking under proper restrictions; and the methods by which enlarged membership in the federal reserve system may be brought about. postal savings banks the postal savings deposits have increased from about $200,000,000 to about $550,000,000 during the past year. this experience has raised important practical questions in relation to deposits and investments which should receive the attention of the congress. railways the railways present one of our immediate and pressing problems. they are and must remain the backbone of our transportation system. their prosperity is interrelated with the prosperity of all industries. their fundamental service in transportation, the volume of their employment, their buying power for supplies from other industries, the enormous investment in their securities, particularly their bonds, by insurance companies, savings banks, benevolent and other trusts, all reflect their partnership in the whole economic fabric. through these institutions the railway bonds are in a large sense the investment of every family. the well-maintained and successful operation and the stability of railway finances are of primary importance to economic recovery. they should have more effective opportunity to reduce operating costs by proper consolidation. as their rates must be regulated in public interest, so also approximate regulation should be applied to competing services by some authority. the methods of their regulation should be revised. the interstate commerce commission has made important and far-reaching recommendations upon the whole subject, which i commend to the early consideration of the congress. antitrust laws in my message of a year ago i commented on the necessity of congressional inquiry into the economic action of the antitrust laws. there is wide conviction that some change should be made especially in the procedure under these laws. i do not favor their repeal. such action would open wide the door to price fixing, monopoly, and destruction of healthy competition. particular attention should be given to the industries rounded upon natural resources, especially where destructive competition produces great wastes of these resources and brings great hardships upon operators, employees, and the public. in recent years there has been continued demoralization in the bituminous coal, oil, and lumber industries. i again commend the matter to the consideration of the congress. unemployment as an aid to unemployment the federal government is engaged in the greatest program of public-building, harbor, flood-control, highway, waterway, aviation, merchant and naval ship construction in all history. our expenditures on these works during this calendar year will reach about $780,000,000 compared with $260,000,000 in 1928. through this increased construction, through the maintenance of a full complement of federal employees, and through services to veterans it is estimated that the federal taxpayer is now directly contributing to the livelihood of 10,000,000 of our citizens. we must avoid burdens upon the government which will create more unemployment in private industry than can be gained by further expansion of employment by the federal government. we can now stimulate employment and agriculture more effectually and speedily through the voluntary measures in progress, through the thawing out of credit, through the building up of stability abroad, through the home loan discount banks, through an emergency finance corporation and the rehabilitation of the railways and other such directions. i am opposed to any direct or indirect government dole. the breakdown and increased unemployment in europe is due in part to such practices. our people are providing against distress from unemployment in true american fashion by a magnificent response to public appeal and by action of the local governments. general legislation there are many other subjects requiring legislative action at this session of the congress. i may list the following among them: veterans\\' services the law enacted last march authorizing loans of 50 per cent upon adjusted-service certificates has, together with the loans made under previous laws, resulted in payments of about $1,260,000,000. appropriations have been exhausted. the administrator of veterans\\' affairs advises that a further appropriation of $200,000,000 is required at once to meet the obligations made necessary by existing legislation. there will be demands for further veterans\\' legislation; there are inequalities in our system of veterans\\' relief; it is our national duty to meet our obligations to those who have served the nation. but our present expenditure upon these services now exceeds $1,000,000,000 per annum. i am opposed to any extension of these expenditures until the country has recovered from the present situation. electrical-power regulationi have recommended in previous messages the effective regulation of interstate electrical power as the essential function of the reorganized federal power commission. i renew the recommendation. it is urgently needed in public protection. muscle shoals at my suggestion, the governors and legislatures of alabama and tennessee selected three members each for service on a committee to which i appointed a representative of the farm organizations and two representatives of the war department for the purpose of recommending a plan for the disposal of these properties which would be in the interest of the people of those states and the agricultural industry throughout the country. i shall transmit the recommendations to the congress. reorganization of federal departments i have referred in previous messages to the profound need of further reorganization and consolidation of federal administrative functions to eliminate overlap and waste, and to enable coordination and definition of government policies now wholly impossible in scattered and conflicting agencies which deal with parts of the same major function. i shall lay before the congress further recommendations upon this subject, particularly in relation to the department of the interior. there are two directions of such reorganization, however, which have an important bearing upon the emergency problems with which we are confronted. shipping board at present the shipping board exercises large administrative functions independent of the executive. these administrative functions should be transferred to the department of commerce, in keeping with that single responsibility which has been the basis of our governmental structure since its foundation. there should be created in that department a position of assistant secretary for merchant marine, under whom this work and the several bureaus having to do with merchant marine may be grouped. the shipping board should be made a regulatory body acting also in advisory capacity on loans and policies, in keeping with its original conception. its regulatory powers should be amended to include regulation of coastwise shipping so as to assure stability and better service. it is also worthy of consideration that the regulation of rates and services upon the inland waterways should be assigned to such a reorganized board. reorganization of public works administration i recommend that all building and construction activities of the government now carried on by many departments be consolidated into an independent establishment under the president to be known as the \"public works administration\" directed by a public works administrator. this agency should undertake all construction work in service to the different departments of the government (except naval and military work). the services of the corps of army engineers should be delegated in rotation for military duty to this administration in continuation of their supervision of river and harbor work. great economies, sounder policies, more effective coordination to employment, and expedition in all construction work would result from this consolidation. law enforcement i shall present some recommendations in a special message looking to the strengthening of criminal-law enforcement and improvement in judicial procedure connected therewith. inland waterway and harbor improvement these improvements are now proceeding upon an unprecedented scale. some indication of the volume of work in progress is conveyed by the fact that during the current year over 380,000,000 cubic yards of material have been moved—an amount equal to the entire removal in the construction of the panama canal. the mississippi waterway system, connecting chicago, kansas city, pittsburgh, and new orleans, will be in full operation during 1933. substantial progress is being made upon the projects of the upper missouri, upper mississippi, etc. negotiations are now in progress with canada for the construction of the st. lawrence waterway. the tariff wages and standards of living abroad have been materially lowered during the past year. the temporary abandonment of the gold standard by certain countries has also reduced their production costs compared to ours. fortunately any increases in the tariff which may be necessary to protect agriculture and industry from these lowered foreign costs, or decreases in items which may prove to be excessive, may be undertaken at any time by the tariff commission under authority which it possesses by virtue of the tariff act of 1930. the commission during the past year has reviewed the rates upon over 254 items subject to tariff. as a result of vigorous and industrious action, it is up to date in the consideration of pending references and is prepared to give prompt attention to any further applications. this procedure presents an orderly method for correcting inequalities. i am opposed to any general congressional revision of the tariff. such action would disturb industry, business, and agriculture. it would prolong the depression. immigration and deportation i recommend that immigration restriction now in force under administrative action be placed upon a more definite basis by law. the deportation laws should be strengthened. aliens lawfully in the country should be protected by the issuance of a certificate of residence. public health i again call attention to my previous recommendations upon this subject, particularly in its relation to children. the moral results are of the utmost importance. conclusion it is inevitable that in these times much of the legislation proposed to the congress and many of the recommendations of the executive must be designed to meet emergencies. in reaching solutions we must not jeopardize those principles which we have found to be the basis of the growth of the nation. the federal government must not encroach upon nor permit local communities to abandon that precious possession of local initiative and responsibility. again, just as the largest measure of responsibility in the government of the nation rests upon local self-government, so does the largest measure of social responsibility in our country rest upon the individual. if the individual surrenders his own initiative and responsibilities, he is surrendering his own freedom and his own liberty. it is the duty of the national government to insist that both the local governments and the individual shall assume and bear these responsibilities as a fundamental of preserving the very basis of our freedom. many vital changes and movements of vast proportions are taking place in the economic world. the effect of these changes upon the future can not be seen clearly as yet. of this, however, we are sure: our system, based upon the ideals of individual initiative and of equality of opportunity, is not an artificial thing. rather it is the outgrowth of the experience of america, and expresses the faith and spirit of our people. it has carried us in a century and a half to leadership of the economic world. if our economic system does not match our highest expectations at all times, it does not require revolutionary action to bring it into accord with any necessity that experience may prove. it has successfully adjusted itself to changing conditions in the past. it will do so again. the mobility of our institutions, the richness of our resources, and the abilities of our people enable us to meet them unafraid. it is a distressful time for many of our people, but they have shown qualities as high in fortitude, courage, and resourcefulness as ever in our history. with that spirit, i have faith that out of it will come a sounder life, a truer standard of values, a greater recognition of the results of honest effort, and a healthier atmosphere in which to rear our children. ours must be a country of such stability and security as can not fail to carry forward and enlarge among all the people that abundant life of material and spiritual opportunity which it has represented among all nations since its beginning.'\n",
      " 'to the senate and house of representatives: in accord with my constitutional duty, i transmit herewith to the congress information upon the state of the union together with recommendation of measures for its consideration. our country is at peace. our national defense has been maintained at a high state of effectiveness. all of the executive departments of the government have been conducted during the year with a high devotion to public interest. there has been a far larger degree of freedom from industrial conflict than hitherto known. education and science have made further advances. the public health is to-day at its highest known level. while we have recently engaged in the aggressive contest of a national election, its very tranquillity and the acceptance of its results furnish abundant proof of the strength of our institutions. in the face of widespread hardship our people have demonstrated daily a magnificent sense of humanity, of individual and community responsibility for the welfare of the less fortunate. they have grown in their conceptions and organization for cooperative action for the common welfare. in the provision against distress during this winter, the great private agencies of the country have been mobilized again; the generosity of our people has again come into evidence to a degree in which all america may take great pride. likewise the local authorities and the states are engaged everywhere in supplemental measures of relief. the provisions made for loans from the reconstruction finance corporation, to states that have exhausted their own resources, guarantee that there should be no hunger or suffering from cold in the country. the large majority of states are showing a sturdy cooperation in the spirit of the federal aid. the surgeon general, in charge of the public health service, furnishes me with the following information upon the state of public health: mortality rate per 1,000 of population on an annual basis from representative statesthe sickness rates from data available show the same trends. these facts indicate the fine endeavor of the agencies which have been mobilized for care of those in distress. economic situation the unparalleled world-wide economic depression has continued through the year. due to the european collapse, the situation developed during last fall and winter into a series of most acute crises. the unprecedented emergency measures enacted and policies adopted undoubtedly saved the country from economic disaster. after serving to defend the national security, these measures began in july to show their weight and influence toward improvement of conditions in many parts of the country. the following tables of current business indicators show the general economic movement during the past eleven months. monthly business indices with seasonal variations eliminated[monthly average 1923-1925=100] the measures and policies which have procured this turn toward recovery should be continued until the depression is passed, and then the emergency agencies should be promptly liquidated. the expansion of credit facilities by the federal reserve system and the reconstruction finance corporation has been of incalculable value. the loans of the latter for reproductive works, and to railways for the creation of employment; its support of the credit structure through loans to banks, insurance companies, railways, building and loan associations, and to agriculture has protected the savings and insurance policies of millions of our citizens and has relieved millions of borrowers from duress; they have enabled industry and business to function and expand. the assistance given to farm loan banks, the establishment of the home loan banks and agricultural credit associations—all in their various ramifications have placed large sums of money at the disposal of the people in protection and aid. beyond this, the extensive organization of the country in voluntary action has produced profound results. the following table indicates direct expenditures of the federal government in aid to unemployment, agriculture, and financial relief over the past four years. the sums applied to financial relief multiply themselves many fold, being in considerable measure the initial capital supplied to the reconstruction finance corporation, farm loan banks, etc., which will be recovered to the treasury.(1) public building, highways, rivers and harbors and their maintenance, naval and other vessels construction, hospitals, etc. continued constructive policies promoting the economic recovery of the country must be the paramount duty of the government. the result of the agencies we have created and the policies we have pursued has been to buttress our whole domestic financial structure and greatly to restore credit facilities. but progress in recovery requires another element as well—that is fully restored confidence in the future. institutions and men may have resources and credit but unless they have confidence progress is halting and insecure. there are three definite directions in which action by the government at once can contribute to strengthen further the forces of recovery by strengthening of confidence. they are the necessary foundations to any other action, and their accomplishment would at once promote employment and increase prices. the first of these directions of action is the continuing reduction of all government expenditures, whether national, state, or local. the difficulties of the country demand undiminished efforts toward economy in government in every direction. embraced in this problem is the unquestioned balancing of the federal budget. that is the first necessity of national stability and is the foundation of further recovery. it must be balanced in an absolutely safe and sure manner if full confidence is to be inspired. the second direction for action is the complete reorganization at once of our banking system. the shocks to our economic life have undoubtedly been multiplied by the weakness of this system, and until they are remedied recovery will be greatly hampered. the third direction for immediate action is vigorous and whole souled cooperation with other governments in the economic field. that our major difficulties find their origins in the economic weakness of foreign nations requires no demonstration. the first need to-day is strengthening of commodity prices. that can not be permanently accomplished by artificialities. it must be accomplished by expansion in consumption of goods through the return of stability and confidence in the world at large and that in turn can not be fully accomplished without cooperation with other nations. balancing the budget i shall in due course present the executive budget to the congress. it will show proposed reductions in appropriations below those enacted by the last session of the congress by over $830,000,000. in addition i shall present the necessary executive orders under the recent act authorizing the reorganization of the federal government which, if permitted to go into force, will produce still further substantial economies. these sums in reduction of appropriations will, however, be partially offset by an increase of about $250,000,000 in uncontrollable items such as increased debt services, etc. in the budget there is included only the completion of the federal public works projects already undertaken or under contract. speeding up of federal public works during the past four years as an aid to employment has advanced many types of such improvements to the point where further expansion can not be justified in their usefulness to the government or the people. as an aid to unemployment we should beyond the normal constructive programs substitute reproductive or so-called self-liquidating works. loans for such purposes have been provided for through the reconstruction finance corporation. this change in character of projects directly relieves the taxpayer and is capable of expansion into a larger field than the direct federal works. the reproductive works constitute an addition to national wealth and to future employment, whereas further undue expansion of federal public works is but a burden upon the future. the federal construction program thus limited to commitments and work in progress under the proposed appropriations contemplates expenditures for the next fiscal year, including naval and other vessel construction, as well as other forms of public works and maintenance, of a total of $442,769,000, as compared with $717,262,000 for the present year. the expenditure on such items over the four years ending june 30 next will amount to $2,350,000,000, or an amount of construction work eight times as great as the cost of the panama canal and, except for completion of certain long-view projects, places the nation in many directions well ahead of its requirements for some years to come. a normal program of about $200,000,000 per annum should hereafter provide for the country\\'s necessities and will permit substantial future reduction in federal expenditures. i recommend that the furlough system installed last year be continued not only because of the economy produced but because, being tantamount to the \"5-day week,\" it sets an example which should be followed by the country and because it embraces within its workings the \"spread work\" principle and thus serves to maintain a number of public servants who would otherwise be deprived of all income. i feel, however, in view of the present economic situation and the decrease in the cost of living by over 20 per cent, that some further sacrifice should be made by salaried officials of the government over and above the 8 1/3 per cent reduction under the furlough system. i will recommend that after exempting the first $1,000 of salary there should be a temporary reduction for one year of 11 per cent of that part of all government salaries in excess of the $1,000 exemption, the result of which, combined with the furlough system, will average about 14.8 per cent reduction in pay to those earning more than $1,000. i will recommend measures to eliminate certain payments in the veterans\\' services. i conceive these outlays were entirely beyond the original intentions of congress in building up veterans\\' allowances. many abuses have grown up from ill-considered legislation. they should be eliminated. the nation should not ask for a reduction in allowances to men and dependents whose disabilities rise out of war service nor to those veterans with substantial service who have become totally disabled from non-war-connected causes and who are at the same time without other support. these latter veterans are a charge on the community at some point, and i feel that in view of their service to the nation as a whole the responsibility should fall upon the federal government. many of the economies recommended in the budget were presented at the last session of the congress but failed of adoption. if the economy and appropriations committees of the congress in canvassing these proposed expenditures shall find further reductions which can be made without impairing essential government services, it will be welcomed both by the country and by myself. but under no circumstances do i feel that the congress should fail to uphold the total of reductions recommended. some of the older revenues and some of the revenues provided under the act passed during the last session of the congress, particularly those generally referred to as the nuisance taxes, have not been as prolific of income as had been hoped. further revenue is necessary in addition to the amount of reductions in expenditures recommended. many of the manufacturers\\' excise taxes upon selected industries not only failed to produce satisfactory revenue, but they are in many ways unjust and discriminatory. the time has come when, if the government is to have an adequate basis of revenue to assure a balanced budget, this system of special manufacturers\\' excise taxes should be extended to cover practically all manufactures at a uniform rate, except necessary food and possibly some grades of clothing. at the last session the congress responded to my request for authority to reorganize the government departments. the act provides for the grouping and consolidation of executive and administrative agencies according to major purpose, and thereby reducing the number and overlap and duplication of effort. executive orders issued for these purposes are required to be transmitted to the congress while in session and do not become effective until after the expiration of 60 calendar days after such transmission, unless the congress shall sooner approve. i shall issue such executive orders within a few days grouping or consolidating over fifty executive and administrative agencies including a large number of commissions and \"independent\" agencies. the second step, of course, remains that after these various bureaus and agencies are placed cheek by jowl into such groups, the administrative officers in charge of the groups shall eliminate their overlap and still further consolidate these activities. therein lie large economies. the congress must be warned that a host of interested persons inside and outside the government whose vision is concentrated on some particular function will at once protest against these proposals. these same sorts of activities have prevented reorganization of the government for over a quarter of a century. they must be disregarded if the task is to be accomplished. banking the basis of every other and every further effort toward recovery is to reorganize at once our banking system. the shocks to our economic system have undoubtedly multiplied by the weakness of our financial system. i first called attention of the congress in 1929 to this condition, and i have unceasingly recommended remedy since that time. the subject has been exhaustively investigated both by the committees of the congress and the officers of the federal reserve system. the banking and financial system is presumed to serve in furnishing the essential lubricant to the wheels of industry, agriculture, and commerce, that is, credit. its diversion from proper use, its improper use, or its insufficiency instantly brings hardship and dislocation in economic life. as a system our banking has failed to meet this great emergency. it can be said without question of doubt that our losses and distress have been greatly augmented by its wholly inadequate organization. its inability as a system to respond to our needs is to-day a constant drain upon progress toward recovery. in this statement i am not referring to individual banks or bankers. thousands of them have shown distinguished courage and ability. on the contrary, i am referring to the system itself, which is so organized, or so lacking in organization, that in an emergency its very mechanism jeopardizes or paralyzes the action of sound banks and its instability is responsible for periodic dangers to our whole economic system. bank failures rose in 1931 to 10 1/2 per cent of all the banks as compared to 1 1/2 per cent of the failures of all other types of enterprise. since january 1, 1930, we have had 4,665 banks suspend, with $3,300,000,000 in deposits. partly from fears and drains from abroad, partly from these failures themselves (which indeed often caused closing of sound banks), we have witnessed hoarding of currency to an enormous sum, rising during the height of the crisis to over $1,600,000,000. the results from interreaction of cause and effect have expressed themselves in strangulation of credit which at times has almost stifled the nation\\'s business and agriculture. the losses, suffering, and tragedies of our people are incalculable. not alone do they lie in the losses of savings to millions of homes, injury by deprival of working capital to thousands of small businesses, but also, in the frantic pressure to recall loans to meet pressures of hoarding and in liquidation of failed banks, millions of other people have suffered in the loss of their homes and farms, businesses have been ruined, unemployment increased, and farmers\\' prices diminished. that this failure to function is unnecessary and is the fault of our particular system is plainly indicated by the fact that in great britain, where the economic mechanism has suffered far greater shocks than our own, there has not been a single bank failure during the depression. again in canada, where the situation has been in large degree identical with our own, there have not been substantial bank failures. the creation of the reconstruction finance corporation and the amendments to the federal reserve act served to defend the nation in a great crisis. they are not remedies; they are relief. it is inconceivable that the reconstruction corporation, which has extended aid to nearly 6,000 institutions and is manifestly but a temporary device, can go on indefinitely. it is to-day a matter of satisfaction that the rate of bank failures, of hoarding, and the demands upon the reconstruction corporation have greatly lessened. the acute phases of the crisis have obviously passed and the time has now come when this national danger and this failure to respond to national necessities must be ended and the measures to end them can be safely undertaken. methods of reform have been exhaustively examined. there is no reason now why solution should not be found at the present session of the congress. inflation of currency or governmental conduct of banking can have no part in these reforms. the government must abide within the field of constructive organization, regulation, and the enforcement of safe practices only. parallel with reform in the banking laws must be changes in the federal farm loan banking system and in the joint stock land banks. some of these changes should be directed to permanent improvement and some to emergency aid to our people where they wish to fight to save their farms and homes. i wish again to emphasize this view—that these widespread banking reforms are a national necessity and are the first requisites for further recovery in agriculture and business. they should have immediate consideration as steps greatly needed to further recovery. economic cooperation with other nations our major difficulties during the past two years find their origins in the shocks from economic collapse abroad which in turn are the aftermath of the great war. if we are to secure rapid and assured recovery and protection for the future we must cooperate with foreign nations in many measures. we have actively engaged in a world disarmament conference where, with success, we should reduce our own tax burdens and the tax burdens of other major nations. we should increase political stability of the world. we should lessen the danger of war by increasing defensive powers and decreasing offensive powers of nations. we would thus open new vistas of economic expansion for the world. we are participating in the formulation of a world economic conference, successful results from which would contribute much to advance in agricultural prices, employment, and business. currency depreciation and correlated forces have contributed greatly to decrease in price levels. moreover, from these origins rise most of the destructive trade barriers now stifling the commerce of the world. we could by successful action increase security and expand trade through stability in international exchange and monetary values. by such action world confidence could be restored. it would bring courage and stability, which will reflect into every home in our land. the european governments, obligated to us in war debts, have requested that there should be suspension of payments due the united states on december 15 next, to be accompanied by exchange of views upon this debt question. our government has informed them that we do not approve of suspension of the december 15 payments. i have stated that i would recommend to the congress methods to overcome temporary exchange difficulties in connection with this payment from nations where it may be necessary. in the meantime i wish to reiterate that here are three great fields of international action which must be considered not in part but as a whole. they are of most vital interest to our people. within them there are not only grave dangers if we fail in right action but there also tie immense opportunities for good if we shall succeed. within success there lie major remedies for our economic distress and major progress in stability and security to every fireside in our country. the welfare of our people is dependent upon successful issue of the great causes of world peace, world disarmament, and organized world recovery. nor is it too much to say that to-day as never before the welfare of mankind and the preservation of civilization depend upon our solution of these questions. such solutions can not be attained except by honest friendship, by adherence to agreements entered upon until mutually revised and by cooperation amongst nations in a determination to find solutions which will be mutually beneficial. other legislation i have placed various legislative needs before the congress in previous messages, and these views require no amplification on this occasion. i have urged the need for reform in our transportation and power regulation, in the antitrust laws as applied to our national resource industries, western range conservation, extension of federal aid to child health services, membership in the world court, the ratification of the great lakes-st. lawrence seaway treaty, revision of the bankruptcy acts, revision of federal court procedure, and many other pressing problems. these and other special subjects i shall where necessary deal with by special communications to the congress. the activities of our government are so great, when combined with the emergency activities which have arisen out of the world crisis, that even the briefest review of them would render the annual message unduly long. i shall therefore avail myself of the fact that every detail of the government is covered in the reports to the congress by each of the departments and agencies of the government. conclusion it seems to me appropriate upon this occasion to make certain general observations upon the principles which must dominate the solution of problems now pressing upon the nation. legislation in response to national needs will be effective only if every such act conforms to a complete philosophy of the people\\'s purposes and destiny. ours is a distinctive government with a unique history and background, consciously dedicated to specific ideals of liberty and to a faith in the inviolable sanctity of the individual human spirit. furthermore, the continued existence and adequate functioning of our government in preservation of ordered liberty and stimulation of progress depends upon the maintenance of state, local, institutional, and individual sense of responsibility. we have builded a system of individualism peculiarly our own which must not be forgotten in any governmental acts, for from it have grown greater accomplishments than those of any other nation. on the social and economic sides, the background of our american system and the motivation of progress is essentially that we should allow free play of social and economic forces as far as will not limit equality of opportunity and as will at the same time stimulate the initiative and enterprise of our people. in the maintenance of this balance the federal government can permit of no privilege to any person or group. it should act as a regulatory agent and not as a participant in economic and social life. the moment the government participates, it becomes a competitor with the people. as a competitor it becomes at once a tyranny in whatever direction it may touch. we have around us numerous such experiences, no one of which can be found to have justified itself except in cases where the people as a whole have met forces beyond their control, such as those of the great war and this great depression, where the full powers of the federal government must be exerted to protect the people. but even these must be limited to an emergency sense and must be promptly ended when these dangers are overcome. with the free development of science and the consequent multitude of inventions, some of which are absolutely revolutionary in our national life, the government must not only stimulate the social and economic responsibility of individuals and private institutions but it must also give leadership to cooperative action amongst the people which will soften the effect of these revolutions and thus secure social transformations in an orderly manner. the highest form of self-government is the voluntary cooperation within our people for such purposes. but i would emphasize again that social and economic solutions, as such, will not avail to satisfy the aspirations of the people unless they conform with the traditions of our race deeply grooved in their sentiments through a century and a half of struggle for ideals of life that are rooted in religion and fed from purely spiritual springs.'\n",
      " 'mr. speaker, mr. president, distinguished members of the congress,  honored guests and fellow citizens, thank you for allowing me to delay my  address until this evening. we paused together to mourn and honor the valor of  our seven challenger heroes . and i hope that we are now ready to do what they  would want us to do — go forward america and reach for the stars. (applause.)  we will never forget those brave seven, but we shall go forward.mr. speaker, before i begin my prepared remarks, may i point out that  tonight marks the 10th and last state of the union message that you\\'ve  presided over. and on behalf of the american people, i want to salute you  for your service to congress and country. (applause)i have come to review with you the progress of our nation, to speak of  unfinished work, and to set our sights on the future. i am pleased to  report the state of our union is stronger than a year ago, and growing  stronger each day. (applause.) tonight, we look out on a rising america —  firm of heart, united in spirit, powerful in pride and patriotism —  america is on the move!but, it wasn\\'t long ago that we looked out on a different land — locked  factory gates, long gasoline lines, intolerable prices and interest rates  turning the greatest country on earth into a land of broken dreams.  government growing beyond our consent had become a lumbering giant,  slamming shut the gates of opportunity, threatening to crush the very roots of  our freedom.what brought america back? the american people brought us back — with  quiet courage and common sense; (applause) with undying faith that in this  nation under god the future will be ours, for the future belongs to the  free.tonight the american people deserve our thanks — for 37 straight months  of economic growth; for sunrise firms and modernized industries creating 9  million new jobs in 3 years; interest rates cut in half, inflation falling  over from 12 percent in 1980 to under 4 today; and a mighty river of good  works, a record $74 billion in voluntary giving just last year alone.and despite the pressures of our modern world, family and community  remain the moral core of our society, guardians of our values and hopes for  the future. family and community are the co-stars of this great american  comeback. they are why we say tonight: private values must be at the heart of  public policies.what is true for families in america is true for america in the family  of free nations. history is no captive of some inevitable force. history is  made by men and women of vision and courage. tonight, freedom is on the  march. the united states is the economic miracle, the model to which the  world once again turns. we stand for an idea whose time is now: only by  lifting the weights from the shoulders of all can people truly prosper and can  peace among all nations be secure.teddy roosevelt said that a nation that does great work lives forever.  we have done well, but we cannot stop at the foothills when everest  beckons. it\\'s time for america to be all that we can be.we speak tonight of an \"agenda for the future,\"  an agenda for a safer, more secure world. and we speak about the  necessities for actions to steel us for the challenges of growth, trade and  security in the next decade and the year 2000. and we will do it — not by  breaking faith with bedrock principles, but by breaking free from failed policies. (applause.)let us begin where storm clouds loom darkest — right here in  washington, d.c. this week i will send you our detailed proposals; tonight,  let us speak of our responsibility to redefine government\\'s role: not to  control, not to demand or command, not to contain us; but to help in times of  need, and above all, to create a ladder of opportunity to full  employment so that all americans can climb toward economic power and  justice on their own.but we cannot win the race to the future shackled to a system that can\\'t  even pass a federal budget. we cannot win that race held back by  horse-and-buggy programs that waste tax dollars and squander human  potential. we cannot win that race if we\\'re swamped in a sea of red ink.now, mr. speaker, you know, i know, and the american people know the  federal budget system is broken. it doesn\\'t work. before we leave this  city, let\\'s you and i work together to fix it. (applause.) and then we can  finally given the american people a balanced budget. (applause.)members of congress, passage of  gramm-rudman-hollings gives us an  historic opportunity to achieve what has eluded our national leadership for  decades, forcing federal government to live within its means.your schedule now requires that the budget resolution be passed by april  15th, the very day america\\'s families have to foot the bill for the budgets  that you produce.how often we read of a husband and wife both working, struggling from  paycheck to paycheck to raise a family, meet a mortgage, pay their taxes  and bills. and yet, some in congress say taxes must be raised. well, i\\'m  sorry — they\\'re asking the wrong people to tighten their belts.  (applause.) it\\'s time we reduce the federal budget and left the family  budget alone. (applause.) we do not face large deficits because american  families are undertaxed; we face those deficits because the federal  government overspends.the detailed budget that we will submit will meet the  gramm-rudman-hollings target for deficit reductions, meet our commitment to  ensure a strong national defense, meet our commitment to protect social  security and the truly less fortunate, and, yes, meet our commitment to not  raise taxes. (applause.)how should we accomplish this? well, not by taking from those in need.  as families take care of their own, government must provide shelter and  nourishment for those who cannot provide for themselves. but we must revise or  replace programs enacted in the name of compassion that degrade the moral  worth of work, encourage family breakups, and drive entire communities  into a bleak and heartless dependency.gramm-rudman-hollings can mark a dramatic improvement. but experience  shows that simply setting deficit targets does not assure they\\'ll be met. we  must proceed with grace commission reforms against waste. and tonight, i ask  you to give me what 43 governors have — give me a line-item veto this year.  (applause.) give me the authority to veto waste, and i\\'ll take the  responsibility, i\\'ll make the cuts, i\\'ll take the heat.this authority would not give me any monopoly power, but simply prevent  spending measures from sneaking through that could not pass on their own  merit. and you can sustain or override my veto — that\\'s, that\\'s the way the  system should work. once we\\'ve made the hard choices, we should lock in our  gains with a balanced budget amendment to the constitution. (applause.) i  mentioned that we will meet our commitment to national defense. we must  meet it. defense is not just another budget expense. keeping america strong,  free, and at peace is solely the responsibility of the federal government;  it is government\\'s prime responsibility. we have devoted five years trying  to narrow a dangerous gap born of illusion and neglect. and we\\'ve made  important gains. yet the threat from soviet forces, conventional and  strategic, from the soviet drive for domination, from the increase in  espionage and state terror remains great. this is reality. closing our eyes  will not make reality disappear.we pledge together to hold real growth in defense spending to the bare  minimum. my budget honors that pledge. and i\\'m now asking you, the  congress, to keep its end of the bargain. the soviets must know that if  america reduces her defenses, it will be because of a reduced threat, not a  reduced resolve. (applause.)keeping america strong is as vital to the national security as  controlling federal spending is to our economic security. but, as i have  said before, the most powerful force we can enlist against the federal  deficit is an ever-expanding american economy, unfettered and free.the magic of opportunity — unreserved, unfailing, unrestrained — isn\\'t  this the calling that unites us? i believe our tax rate cuts for the people  have done more to spur a spirit of risk-taking and help america\\'s economy  break free than any program since john kennedy\\'s tax cut almost a quarter  century ago.now history calls us to press on, to complete efforts for an historic  tax reform providing new opportunity for all and ensuring that all pay  their fair share — but no more. we\\'ve come this far. will you join me now and  we\\'ll walk this last mile together? (applause.)you know my views on this. we cannot and we will not accept tax reform  that is a tax increase in disguise. true reform must be an engine of  productivity and growth, and that means a top personal rate no higher than 35  percent. true reform must be truly fair and that means raising personal  exemptions to $2,000. true reform means a tax system that at long last is  pro-family, pro-jobs, pro-future, and pro-america. (applause.)as we knock down the barriers to growth, we must redouble our efforts  for freer and fairer trade. we have already taken actions to counter unfair  trading practices to pry open closed foreign markets. we will continue to do  so. we will also oppose legislation touted as providing protection that in  reality pits one american worker against another, one industry against  another, one community against another, and that raises prices for us all. if  the united states can trade with other nations on a level playing field, we  can out-produce, out-compete, and out-sell anybody, anywhere in the world.  (applause.)the constant expansion of our economy and exports requires a sound and  stable dollar at home and reliable exchange rates around the world. we must  never gain permit wild currency swings to cripple our farmers and other  exporters. farmers, in particular, have suffered from past unwise  government policies. they must not be abandoned with problems they did not  create and cannot control. we\\'ve begun coordinating economic and monetary  policy among our major trading partners. but therehs more to do, and  tonight i am directing treasury secretary jim baker to determine if the  nations of the world should convene to discuss the role and relationship of our  currencies. (applause.)confident in our future, and secure in our values, americans are  striving forward to embrace the future. we see it not only in our recovery,  but in three straight years of falling crime rates, as families and  communities band together to fight pornography, drugs, and lawlessness, and to  give back to their children the safe and, yes, innocent childhood they  deserve. we see it in the renaissance in education, the rising sat  scores for three years — last year\\'s increase the greatest since 1963. it  wasn\\'t government and washington lobbies that turned education around, it was  the american people who, in reaching for excellence, knew to reach back to  basics. we must continue the advance by supporting discipline in our schools; vouchers that give parents freedom of choice; and we must give  back to our children their lost right to acknowledge god in their  classrooms. (applause.)we are a nation of idealists, yet today there is a wound in our national  conscience; america will never be whole as long as the right to life  granted by our creator is denied to the unborn. for the rest of my time, i  shall do what i can to see that this wound is one day healed. (applause.)as we work to make the american dream real for all, we must also look to  the condition of america\\'s families. struggling parents today worry how  they will provide their children the advantages that their parents gave  them. in the welfare culture, the breakdown of the family, the most basic  support system, has reached crisis proportions — in female and child  poverty, child abandonment, horrible crimes and deteriorating schools.  after hundreds of billions of dollars in poverty programs, the plight of the  poor grows more painful. but the waste in dollars and cents pales  before the most tragic loss — the sinful waste of human spirit and potential.we can ignore this terrible truth no longer. as  franklin roosevelt  warned 51 years ago, standing before this chamber, he said, \"welfare  is a narcotic, a subtle destroyer of the human spirit.\" and we must  now escape the spider\\'s web of dependency. tonight i am charging the  white house domestic council to present me by december 1, 1986, an  evaluation of programs and a strategy for immediate action to meet the  financial, educational, social, and safety concerns of poor families. i am talking about real and lasting emancipation, because the success of welfare  should be judged by how many of its recipients become independent of  welfare. (applause.)further, after seeing how devastating illness can destroy the financial  security of the family, i am directing the secretary of health and human  services, dr. otis bowen, to report to me by year end with recommendations on  how the private sector and government can work together to address the  problems of affordable insurance for those whose life savings would  otherwise be threatened when catastrophic illness strikes.and tongight i want to speak directly to america\\'s younger generation,  because you hold the destiny of our nation in your hands. with all the  temptations young people face it sometimes seems the allure of the  permissive society requires superhuman feats of self-control. but the call of  the future is too strong, the challenge too great to get lost in the blind  alleyways of dissolution, drugs, and despair.never has there been a more exciting time to be alive — a time of  rousing wonder and heroic achievement. as they said in the film, back to  the future, \"where we are going, we don\\'t need roads.\"  well, today physicists peering into the infinitely small realms of  subatomic particles find reaffirmations of religious faith. astronomers build a  space telescope that can see to the edge of the universe and possibly back to  the moment of creation.so, yes, this nation remains fully committed to  america\\'s space program .  we\\'re going forward with our shuttle flights, we\\'re going forward to build  our space station, and we are going forward with research on a new orient  express that could, by the end of the next decade, take off from dulles  airport, accelerate up to 25 times the speed of sound, attaining low earth  orbit or flying to tokyo within two hours. (applause.)and the same technology transforming our lives can solve the greatest  problem of the 20th century. a security shield can one day render nuclear  weapons obsolete and free mankind from the prison of nuclear terror.  (applause.) america met one historic challenge and went to the moon. now  america must meet another — to make our strategic defense real for all the  citizens of planet earth.let us speak of our deepest longing for the future — to leave our  children a land that is free and just and a world at peace. it is my hope  that our fireside summit in geneva and mr. gorbachev\\'s upcoming visit to  america can lead to a more stable relationship. surely no people no earth  hate war more or love peace more than we americans. (applause.)but we cannot stroll into the future with child-like faith. our  differences with a system that openly proclaims and practices an alleged  right to command people\\'s lives and to export its ideology by force are  deep and abiding.logic and history compel us to accept that our relationship be guided by  realism — rockhard, clear-eyed, steady, and sure. our negotiators in  geneva have proposed a radical cut in offensive forces by each side, with no  cheating. they have made clear that soviet compliance with the letter and  spirit of agreements is essential. if the soviet government wants an  agreement that truly reduces nuclear arms, there will be an agreement.  (applause.)but arms control is no substitute for peace. we know that peace follows  in freedom\\'s path and conflicts erupt when the will of the people is  denied. so we must prepare for peace not only by reducing weapons but by  bolstering prosperity, liberty, and democracy however and wherever we can.  (applause.)we advance the promise of opportunity every time we speak out on behalf  of lower tax rates, freer markets, sound currencies around the world. we  strengthen the family of freedom evey time we work with allies and come to the  aid of friends under seige. and we can enlarge the family of free nations  if we will defend the unalienable rights of all god\\'s children to follow  their dreams.to those imprisoned in regimed held captive, to those beaten for daring  to fight for freedom and democracy — for their right to worship, to speak, to  live and to prosper in the family of free nations — we say to you  tonight: you are not alone freedom fighters. america will support you with  moral and material assistance your right not just to fight and die for  freedom, but to fight and with freedom — (applause) — to win freedom in  afghanistan; in angola; in cambodia; and in nicaragua . (applause.)this is a great moral challenge for the entire world. surely, no issue  is more important for peace in our own hemisphere, for the security of our  frontiers, for the protection of our vital interests — than to achieve  democracy in nicaragua and to protect nicaragua\\'s democratic neighbors.this year i will be asking congress for the means to do what must be  done for the great and good cause. as scoop jackson, the inspiration for  our bipartisan commission on central america, once said, \"in  matters of national security, the best politics is no politics.\"  (applause.)what we accomplish the year, in each challenge we face, will set our  course for the balance of the decade, indeed for the remainder of the  century. after all we\\'ve done so far, let no one say that this nation  cannot reach the destiny of our dreams. america believes, america is ready,  america can win the race to the future — and we shall.the american dream is a song of hope that rings through night winter  air. vivid, tender music that warms our hearts when the least among us  aspire to the greatest things — to venture a daring enterprises; to  unearth new beauty in music, literature, and art; to discover a new  universe inside a tiny silicon chip or a single human cell.we see the dream coming true in the spirit of discovery of richard  cavoli — all his life he\\'s been enthralled by the mysteries of medicine.  and richard, we know that the experiment that you began in high school was  launched and lost last week, yet your dream lives. and as long as it\\'s  real, work of noble note will yet be done — work that could reduce the  harmful effects of x rays on patients and enable astronomers to view the  golden gateways of the farthest stars.we see the dream glow in the towering talent of a twelve year-old,  tyrone ford — a child prodigy of gospel music, he has surmounted personal  adversity to become an accomplished pianist and singer. he also directs the  choirs of three churches and has performed at the kennedy center.with god as your composer, tyrone, your music will be the music of  angels.we see the dream being saved by the courage of the thirteen year-old,  shelby butler — honor student and member of her school\\'s safety patrol.  seeing another girl freeze in terror before an out-of-control school bus, she  riksed her life and pulled her to safety. with bravery like yours, shelby,  america need never fear for our future.and we see the dream born again in the joyful compassion of a thirteen  year-old, trevor ferrell. two years ago, age eleven, watching men and women  bedding down in abandoned doorways — on television he was watching —  trevor left his suburban philadelphia home to bring blankets and food to the  helpless and homeless. and now, 250 people help him fulfill his nightly vigil.trevor, yours is the living spirit of brotherly love. would you four  stand up for a moment? (applause.)thank you, thank you. you are heroes of our hearts. we look at you and  know it\\'s true — in this land of dreams fulfilled, where greater dreams  may be imagined, nothing is impossible, no victory is beyond our reach, no  glory will every be too great.so now, it\\'s up to us, all of us, to prepare america for that day when  our work will pale before the greatness of america\\'s champions in the 21st  century. the world\\'s hopes rest with america\\'s future; america\\'s hopes rest  with us. so let us go forward to create our world of tomorrow in faith, in  unity, and in love.god bless you and god bless america. (applause.)'\n",
      " 'thank you very much. mr. speaker, mr. president, distinguished members of congress, honored guests and fellow citizens. may i congratulate all of you who are members of this historic 100th congress of the united states of america. in this 200th anniversary year of our constitution, you and i stand on the shoulders of giants — men whose words and deeds put wind in the sails of freedom.however, we must always remember that our constitution is to be celebrated not for being old, but for being young — young with the same energy, spirit, and promise that filled each eventful day in philadelphia\\'s state house. we will be guided tonight by their acts; and we will be guided forever by their words.now, forgive me, but i can\\'t resist sharing a story from those historic days. philadelphia was bursting with civic pride in the spring of 1787, and its newspapers began embellishing the arrival of the convention delegates with elaborate social classifications.governors of states were called \"excellency.\" justices and chancellors had reserved for them \"honorable\" with a capital \"h.\" for congressmen, it was \"honorable\" with a small \"h.\" and all others were referred to as \"the following respectable characters.\" (laughter.)well, for this 100th congress, i invoke special executive powers to declare that each of you must never be titled less than honorable with a capital \"h.\" (applause.) incidentally, i\\'m delighted you\\'re celebrating the 100th birthday of the congress. it\\'s always a pleasure to congratulate someone with more birthdays than i\\'ve had. (laughter.)now, there\\'s a new face at this place of honor tonight. and please join me in warm congratulations to the speaker of the house, jim wright. (applause.) mr. speaker, you might recall a similar situation in your very first session of congress, 32 years ago. then, as now, the speakership had changed hands and another great son of texas, sam rayburn — \"mr. sam\" — sat in your chair. i cannot find better words than those used by president eisenhower that evening. he said, \"we shall have much to do together; i am sure that we will get it done and that we shall do it in harmony and goodwill.\" (applause.)tonight, i renew that pledge. to you, mr. speaker, and to senate majority leader robert byrd, who brings 34 years of distinguished service to the congress, may i say: though there are changes in the congress, america\\'s interests remain the same. and i am confident that, along with republican leaders bob michel and bob dole, this congress can make history. (applause.)six years ago, i was here to ask the congress to join me in america\\'s new beginning. well, the results are something of which we can all be proud. our inflation rate is now the lowest in a in a quarter of a century.the prime interest rate has fallen from the 21 and a half percent the month before we took office to seven and a half percent today, and those rates have triggered the most housing starts in eight years.the unemployment rate — still too high — is the lowest in nearly seven years, and our people have created nearly 13 million new jobs. over 61 percent of everyone over the age of 16, male and female, is employed the highest percentagc on record.let\\'s roll up our sleeves and go to work, and put america\\'s economic engine at full throttle. (applause.)we can also be heartened by our progress across the world. most important, america is at peace tonight, and freedom is on the march. and we\\'ve done much these past years to restore our defenses, our alliances, and our leadership in the world. (applause.) our sons and daughters in the services once again wear their uniforms with pride.but though we\\'ve made much progress, i have one major regret. i took a risk with regard to our action in iran. it did not work, and for that i assume full responsibility.the goals were worthy. i do not believe it was wrong to try to establish contacts with a country of strategic importance or to try to save lives. and certainly it was not wrong to try to secure freedom for our citizens held in barbaric captivity. (applause.) but we did not achieve what we wished, and serious mistakes were made in trying to do so. we will get to the bottom of this, and i will take whatever action is called for.but in debating the past (applause) — in debating the past, we must not deny ourselves the successes of the future. let it never be said of this generation of americans that we became so obsessed with failure that we refused to take risks that could further the cause of peace and freedom in the world. (applause.)much is at stake here, and the nation and the world are watching — to see if we go forward together in the national interest, or if we let partisanship weaken us.and let there be no mistake about american policy: we will not sit idly by if our interests or our friends in the middle east are threatened, nor will we yield to terrorist blackmail.and now, ladies and gentlemen of the congress, why don\\'t we get to work? (applause.)i am pleased to report that, because of our efforts to rebuild the strength of america, the world is a safer place. earlier this month, i submitted a budget to defend america and maintain our momentum to make up for neglect in the last decade. well, i ask you to vote out a defense and foreign affairs budget that says \"yes\" to protecting our country. while the world is safer, it is not safe.since 1970, the soviets have invested $500 billion more on their military forces than we have. even today, though nearly one in three soviet families is without running hot water, and the average family spends two hours a day shopping for the basic necessities of life, their government still found the resources to transfer $75 billion in weapons to client states in the past five years — clients like syria, vietnam, cuba, libya, angola, ethiopia, afghanistan, and nicaragua.with 120,000 soviet combat and military personnel and 15,000 military advisers in asia, africa, and latin america, can anyone still doubt their single-minded determination to expand their power? despite this, the congress cut my request for critical u.s. security assistance to free nations by 21 percent this year, and cut defense requests by $85 billion in the last three years. (applause.)these assistance programs serve our national interests as well as mutual interests, and when the programs are devastated, american interests are harmed. my friends, it\\'s my duty as president to say to you again tonight that there is no surer way to lose freedom than to lose our resolve. (applause.)today, the brave people of afghanistan are showing that resolve. the soviet union says it wants a peaceful settlement in afghanistan, yet it continues a brutal war and props up a regime whose days are clearly numbered. we are ready to support a political solution that guarantees the rapid withdrawal of all soviet troops and genuine self-determination for the afghan people.in central america, too, the cause of freedom is being tested. and our resolve is being tested there as well. here, especially, the world is watching to see how this nation responds.today, over 90 percent of the people of latin america live in democracy. democracy is on the march in central and south america. communist nicaragua is the odd man out — suppressing the church, the press, and democratic dissent and promoting subversion in the region. we support diplomatic efforts, but these efforts can never succeed if the  sandinistas win their war against the nicaraguan people.our commitment to a western hemisphere safe from aggression did not occur by spontaneous generation on the day that we took office. it began with the monroe doctrine in 1823 and continues our historic bipartisan american policy. franklin roosevelt said we \"are determined to do everything possible to maintain peace on this hemisphere.\" president truman was very blunt: \"international communism seeks to crush and undermine and destroy the independence of the americans. we cannot let that happen here.\" and john f. kennedy made clear that \"communist domination in this hemisphere can never be neqotiated.\" (applause.)some in this congress may choose to depart from this historic commitment, but i will not. (applause.)this year we celebrate the second century of our constitution. the sandinistas just signed theirs two weeks ago -and then suspended it. we won\\'t know how my words tonight will be reported there, for one simple reason: there is no free press in nicaragua.nicaraguan freedom fighters have never asked us to wage their battle, but i will fight and effort to shut off their lifeblood and consign them to death, defeat, or a life without freedom. there must be no soviet beachhead in central america. (applause.)you know, we americans have always preferred dialogue to conflict, and so we always remain open to more constructive relations with the soviet union. but more responsible soviet conduct around the world is a key element of the u.s.-soviet agenda. progress is also required on the other items of our agenda as well real respect for human rights, and more open contacts between our societies, and, of course, arms reduction.in iceland last october, we had one moment of opportunity that the soviets dashed because they sought to cripple our strategic defense initiative — sdi. i wouldn\\'t let them do it then. i won\\'t let them do it now or in the future. (applause.) this is the most positive and promising defense program we have undertaken. it\\'s the path for both sides — to a safer future; a system that defends human life instead of threatening it. sdi will go forward.the united states has made serious, fair, and far-reaching proposals to the soviet union, and this is a moment of rare opportunity for arms reduction. but i will need, and american negotiators in geneva will need congress\\' support. enacting the soviet negotiating position into american law would not be the way to win a good agreement. (applause.) so i must tell you in this congress i will veto any effort that undercuts our national security and our negotiating leverage. (applause.)now, today, we also find ourselves engaged in expanding peaceful commerce across the world. we will work to expand our opportunities in international markets through the uruquay round of trade negotiations and to complete an historic free trade arrangement between the world\\'s two largest trading partners — canada and the united states.our basic trade policy remains the same: we remain opposed as ever to protectionism because america\\'s growth and future depend on trade. but we would insist on trade that is fair and free. we are always willing to be trade partners but never trade patsies. (applause.)now from foreign borders, let us return to our own because america in the world is only as strong as america at home.this looth congress has high responsibilities. i begin with a gentle reminder that many of these are simply the incomplete obligations of the past. the american people deserve to be impatient because we do not yet have the public house in order.we\\'ve had great success in restoring our economic integrity, and we\\'ve rescued our nation from the worst economic mess since the depression.but there\\'s more to do. for starters, the federal deficit is outrageous. (applause.)for years i\\'ve asked that we stop pushing onto our children the excesses of our government. (applause.) and what the congress finally needs to do is pass a constitutional amendment that mandates a balanced budget — (applause) and forces government to live within its means. states, cities, and the families of america balance their budgets. why can\\'t we? (applause.)next — the budget process is a sorry spectacle. (applause.) the missing of deadlines and the nightmare of monstrous continuing resolutions packing hundreds of billions of dollars of spending into one bill must be stopped. (applause.)we ask the congress, once again: give us the same tool that 43 governors have — a line-item veto so we can carve out the boondoggles and pork — (applause) — those items that would never survive on their own. i will send the congress broad recommendations on the budget, but first i\\'d like to see yours. let\\'s go to work and get this done together. (applause.)but now, let\\'s talk about this year\\'s budget. even though i have submitted it within the gramm-rudman-hollings deficit reduction target, i have seen suggestions that we might postpone that timetable. well, i think the american people are tired of hearing the same old excuses. (applause.) together, we made a commitment to balance the budget: now, let\\'s keep it. (applause.)as for those suggestions that the answer is higher taxes, the american people have repeatedly rejected that shopworn advice. they know that we don\\'t have deficits because people are are taxed too little; we have deficits because big government spends too much. (applause.)now, next month, next month, i\\'ll place two additional reforms before the congress.we\\'ve created a welfare monster that is a shocking indictment of our sense of priorities. our national welfare system consists of some 59 major programs and over 6,000 pages of federal laws and regulations on which more than $132 billion was spent in 1985.i will propose a new national welfare strategy — a program of welfare reform through state-sponsored, community-based demonstration projects. this is the time to reform this outmoded social dinosaur and finally break the poverty trap. now, we will never abandon those who, through no fault of their own, must have our help. but let us work to see how many can be freed from the dependency of welfare and made self-supporting, which the great majority of welfare recipients want more than anything else. (applause.)next, let us remove a financial specter facing our older americans — the fear of an illness so expensive that it can result in having to make an intolerable choice between bankruptcy and death. i will submit legislation shortly to help free the elderly from the fear of catastrophic illness. (applause.)now, let\\'s turn to the future.it\\'s widely said that america is losing her competitive edge. well, that won\\'t happen if we act now. how well prepared are we to enter the 21st century? in my lifetime, america set the standard for the world. it is now time to determine that we should enter the next century having chieved a level of excellence unsurpassed in history.we will achieve this first, by guaranteeing that government does everything possible to promote america\\'s ability to compete. second, we must act as individuals in a quest for excellence that will not be measured by new proposals or billions in new funding. rather, it involves an expenditure of american spirit and just plain american grit.the congress will soon receive my comprehensive proposals to enhance our competitiveness — includinq new science and technology centers and strong new funding for basic research. (applause.)the bill will include legal and regulatory reforms and weapons to fight unfair trade practices. competitiveness also means giving our farmers a shot at participating fairly and fully in a changing world market.preparing for the future must begin, as always, with our children.we need to set for them new and more rigorous goals. we must demand more of ourselves and our children by raising literacy levels dramatically by the year 2000. our children should master the basic concepts of math and science, and let\\'s insist that students not leave high school until they have studied and understood the basic documents of our national heritage. (applause.)there\\'s one more thing we can\\'t let up on. let\\'s redouble our personal efforts to provide for every child a safe and drug_free learning environment. (applause.) if our crusade against drugs succeeds with our children, we will defeat that scourge all over the country.finally, let\\'s stop suppressing the spiritual core of our national being. our nation could not have been conceived without divine help. why is it that we can build a nation with our prayers but we can\\'t use a schoolroom for voluntary prayer? (applause.) the looth congress of the united states should be remembered as the one that ended the expulsion of god from america\\'s classrooms. (applause.)the quest for excellence into the 21st century begins in the schoolroom but must go next to the workplace. more than 20 million new jobs will be created before the new century unfolds, and, by then, our economy should be able to provide a job for everyone who wants to work.we must also enable our workers to adapt to the rapidly changing nature of the workplace, and i will propose substantial new federal commitments keyed to re-training and job mobility.over the next few weeks, i will be sending the congress a complete series of these special messages — on budget reform, welfare reform, competitiveness, including education, trade, worker training and assistance, agriculture, and other subjects.the congress can give us these tools, but to make these tools work, it really comes down to just beinq our best, and that is the core of american greatness.the responsibility of freedom presses us towards higher knowledge and, i believe, moral and spiritual greatness. through lower taxes and smaller government, government has its ways of freeing people\\'s spirits. but only we, each of us, can let the spirit soar against our own individual standards. excellence is what makes frcedom ring. and isn\\'t that what we do best?we\\'re entering our third century now, but it\\'s wrong to judge our nation by its years. the calendar can\\'t measure america because we were meant to be an endless experiment in freedom with no limit to our reaches, no boundaries to what we can do, no end point to our hopes.the united states constitution is the impassioned and inspired vehicle by which we travel through history. it grew out of the most fundamental inspiration of our existence: that we are here to serve him by living free — that living free releases in us the noblest of impulses and the best of our abilities. that we would use these gifts for good and generous purposes and would secure them not just for ourselves, and for our children, but for all mankind. (applause.)over the years — i won\\'t count if you don\\'t nothing has been so heartwarming to me as speaking to america\\'s young. and the little ones especially so fresh-faced and so eager to know -well, from time to time i\\'ve been with them, they will ask about our constitution, and i hope you members of congress will not deem this a breach of protocol if you\\'ll permit me to share these thoughts again with the young people who might be listening or watching this evening.i have read the constitutions of a number of countries including the soviet union\\'s. now some people are surprised to hear that they have a constitution, and it even supposedly grants a number of freedoms to its people. many countries have written into their constitution provisions for freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. well, if this is true, why is the constitution of the united states so exceptional?well, the difference is so small that it almost escapes you - but it\\'s so great it tells you the whole story in just three words: we the people. in those other constitutions, the government tells the people of those countries what they are allowed to do. in our constitution, we the people tell the government what it can do and that it can do only those things listed in that document and no others.virtually every other revolution in history has just exchanged one set of rulers for another set of rulers. our revolution is the first to say the people are the masters, and government is their servant. (applause.)and you young people out there, don\\'t ever forget that. some day, you could be in this room — but wherever you are, america is depending on you to reach your highest and be your best because here, in america, we the people are in charge.just three words. we the people. those are the kids on christmas day looking out from a frozen sentry post on the 38th parallel in korea, or aboard an aircraft carrier in the mediterranean. a million miles from home. but doing their duty.we the people. those are the warm-hearted whose numbers we can\\'t begin to count who\\'ll begin the day with a little prayer for hostages they will never know and mia families they will never meet. why? because that\\'s the way we are, this unique breed we call americans.we the people. they\\'re farmers on tough times, but who never stop feeding a hungry world. they\\'re the volunteers at the hospital choking back their tears for the hundredth time, caring for a baby strugling for life because of a mother who used drugs. and you\\'ll forgive me a special memory — it\\'s a million mothers like nelle reagan who never knew a stranger or turned a hungry person away from her kitchen door.we the people. they refute last week\\'s television commentary downgrading our optimism and our idealism. they are the entrepreneurs, the builders, the pioneers, and a lot of regular folks the true heroes of our land who make up the most uncommon nation of doers in history. you know they\\'re americans because their spirit is as big as the universe and their hearts are bigger than their spirits.we the people. starting the third century of a dream and standing up to some cynic who\\'s trying to tell us we\\'re not going to get any better.are we at the end? well, i can\\'t tell it any better than the real thing — a story recorded by james madison from the final moments of the constitutional convention — september 17th, 1787. as the last few members signed the document, benjamin franklin— the oldest delegate at 81 years, and in frail health — looked over toward the chair where george washington  daily presided. at the back of the chair was painted the picture of a sun on the horizon. and turning to those sitting next to him, franklin observed that artists found it difficult in their painting to distinguish between a rising and a setting sun.well, i know if we were there, we could see those delegates sitting around  franklin — leaning in to listen more closely to him. and then dr. franklin began to share his deepest hopes and fears about the outcome of their efforts, and this is what he said: \"i have often looked at that picture behind the president without being able to tell whether it was a rising or setting sun: but now at length i have the happiness to know that it is a rising and not a setting sun.\"well, you can bet it\\'s rising, because, my fellow citizens, america  isn\\'t finished her best days have just begun.thank you, god bless you and god bless america. (applause.)'\n",
      " '\"thank you. mr. speaker, mr. president, and distinguished members of the house and senate, when we first met here seven years ago — many of us for the first time — it was with the hope or beginning something new for america. we meet here tonight in this historic chamber to continue that work. if anyone expects just a proud recitation of the accomplishments of my administration, i say let\\'s leave that to history: we\\'re not finished yet. (applause.) so my message to you tonight is, put on your work shoes — we\\'re still on the job. (applause.)history records the power of the ideas that brought us here those seven years ago. ideas like the individual\\'s right to reach as far and as high as his or her talents will permit, the free market as an engine of economic progress and, as an ancient chinese philosopher, lao-tzu, said, \"govern a great nation as you would cook a small fish; do not overdo it.\"well, these ideas were part of a larger notion — a vision, if you will, of america herself — an america not only rich in opportunity for the individual but an america, too, of strong families and vibrant neighborhoods, an america whose divergent but harmonizing communities were a reflection of a deeper community of values — the value of work, of family, of religion — and of the love of freedom that god places in each of us and whose defense he has entrusted in a special way to this nation.all of this was made possible by an idea i spoke of when mr. gorbachev was here — the belief that the most exciting revolution ever known to humankind began with three simple words: \"we the people\" — the revolutionary notion that the people grant government its rights, and not the other way around.and there is one lesson that has come home powerfully to me, which i would offer to you now. just as those who created this republic pledged to each other their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor, so, too, america\\'s leaders today must pledge to each other that we will keep foremost in our hearts and minds not what is best for ourselves or for our party, but what is best for america. (applause.) in the spirit of jefferson, let us affirm that, in this chamber tonight, there are no republicans, no democrats, just americans.yes, we will have our differences. but let us always remember — what unites us far outweighs whatever divides us. those who sent us here to serve them — the millions of americans watching and listening tonight — expect this of us. let\\'s prove to them and to ourselves that democracy works even in an election year.we have done this before. and as we have worked together to bring down spending, tax rates, and inflation, employment has climbed to record heights; america has created more jobs and better, higher-paying jobs; family income has risen for four straight years, and america\\'s poor climbed out of poverty at the fastest rate in more than 10 years. (applause.) our record is not just the longest peacetime expansion in history, but an economic and social revolution of hope, based on work, incentives, growth and opportunity; a revolution of compassion that led to private sector initiatives and a 77 percent increase in charitable giving; a revolution that — at a critical moment in world history — reclaimed and restored the american dream.in international relations, too, there\\'s only one description for what, together, we have achieved — a complete turnabout, a revolution. seven years ago, america was weak and freedom everywhere was under siege. today america is strong and democracy is everywhere on the move. from central america to east asia, ideas like free markets and democratic reforms and human rights are taking hold. we\\'ve replaced \"blame america\" with \"look up to america.\" (applause.) we\\'ve rebuilt our defenses, and, of all our accomplishments, none can give us more satisfaction than knowing that our young people are again proud to wear our country\\'s uniform. (applause.) and in a few moments, i\\'m going to talk about three development — arms reduction, the strategic defense initiative, and the global democratic revolution — that, when taken together, offer a chance none of us would have dared imagine seven years ago, a chance to rid the world of the two great nightmares of the postwar era. i speak of the startling hope of giving our children a future free of both totalitarianism and nuclear terror.tonight, then, we\\'re strong, prosperous, at peace, and we are free. this is the state of our union. and if we will work together this year, i believe we can give a future president and a future congress the chance to make that prosperity, that peace, that freedom, not just the state of our union, but the state of our world. (applause.)toward this end, we have four basic objectives tonight. first, steps we can take this year to keep our economy strong and growing, to give our children a future of low inflation and full employment. second, let\\'s check our progress in attacking social problems where important gains have been made but which still need critical attention. i mean schools that work, economic independence for the poor, restoring respect for family life and family values. our third objective tonight is global — continuing the exciting economic and democratic revolutions we\\'ve seen around the world. fourth and finally, our nation has remained at peace for nearly a decade and a half, as we move toward our goals of world prosperity and world freedom. we must protect that peace and deter war by making sure the next president inherits what you and i have a moral obligation to give that president — a national security that is unassailable and a national defense that takes full advantage of new technology, and is fully funded. applause.)this is a full agenda. it\\'s meant to be. you see, my thinking on the next year is quite simple — let\\'s make this the best of eight. and that means — (applause) — and that means it\\'s all out — right to the finish line. i don\\'t buy the idea that this is the last year of anything, because we\\'re not talking here tonight about registering temporary gains, but ways of making permanent our successes. and that\\'s why our focus is the values, the principles, and ideas that made america great. let\\'s be clear on this point — we\\'re for limited government because we understand, as the founding fathers did, that it is the best way of ensuring personal liberty and empowering the individual so that every american of every race and region shares fully in the flowering of american prosperity and freedom.one other thing we americans like — the future — like the sound of it, the idea of it, the hope of it. where others fear trade and economic growth, we see opportunities for creating new wealth and undreamed-of opportunities for millions in our own land and beyond. where others seek to throw up barriers, we seek to bring them down; where others take counsel of their fears, we follow our hopes. yes, we americans like the future and like making the most of it. let\\'s do that now.and let\\'s begin by discussing how to maintain economic growth by controlling and eventually eliminating the problem of federal deficits. we have had a balanced budget only eight times in the last 57 years. for the first time in 14 years, the federal government spent less in real terms last year than the year before. we took $73 billion off last year\\'s deficit compared to the year before. the deficit itself has moved from 6.3 percent of the gross national product to only 3.4 percent. and perhaps the most important sign of progress has been the change in our view of deficits. you know, a few of us can remember when, not too many years ago, those who created the deficits said they would make us prosperous and not to worry about the debt because \"we owe it to ourselves.\" well, at last there is agreement that we can\\'t spend ourselves rich.our recent budget agreement, designed to reduce federal deficits by $76 billion over the next two years, builds on this consensus. but this agreement must be adhered to without slipping into the errors of the past — more broken promises and more unchecked spending. as i indicated in my first state of the union, what ails us can be simply put: the federal government is too big and it spends too much money. (applause.) i can assure you, the bipartisan leadership of congress, of my help in fighting off any attempt to bust our budget agreement. and this includes the swift and certain use of the veto power.now, it is also time for some plain talk about the most immediate obstacle to controlling federal deficits. the simple but frustrating problem of making expenses match revenues — something american families do and the federal government can\\'t — has caused crisis after crisis in this city. mr. speaker, mr. president, i will say to you tonight what i have said before — and will continue to say: the budget process has broken down; it needs a drastic overhaul. (applause.) with each ensuing year, the spectacle before the american people is the same as it was this christmas — budget deadlines delayed or missed completely, monstrous continuing resolutions that pack hundreds of billions of dollars worth of spending into one bill — and a federal government on the brink of default.i know i\\'m echoing what you here in the congress have said because you suffered so directly — but let\\'s recall that in seven years, of 91 appropriations bills scheduled to arrive on my desk by a certain date, only 10 made it on time. last year, of the 13 appropriations bills due by october 1st, none of them made it. instead, we had four continuing resolutions lasting 41 days, then 36 days, and two days, and three days, respectively. and then, along came these behemoths. (applause.) this is the conference report — 1,053 page report weighing 14 pounds. then this — a reconciliation bill six months late, that was 1,186 pages long, weighing 15 pounds; and the long-term continuing resolution — (applause) — this one was two months late and it\\'s 1,057 pages long, weighing 14 pounds. that was a total of 43 pounds of paper and ink. you had three hours — yes, three hours — to consider each, and it took 300 people at my office of management and budget just to read the bill so the government wouldn\\'t shut down.congress shouldn\\'t send another one of these. (applause.) no — and if you do, i will not sign it. (applause.)let\\'s change all this; instead of a presidential budget that gets discarded and a congressional budget resolution that is not enforced, why not a simple partnership, a joint agreement that sets out the spending priorities within the available revenues? and let\\'s remember our deadline is october 1st, not christmas (applause); let\\'s get the people\\'s work done in time to avoid a footrace with santa claus. (laughter.) and yes, this year — to coin a phrase — a new beginning. thirteen individual bills, on time and fully reviewed by congress.i\\'m also certain you join me in saying: let\\'s help ensure our future of prosperity by giving the president a tool that — though i will not get use to use it — is one i know future presidents of either party must have. give the president the same authority that 43 governors use in their states, the right to reach into massive appropriation bills, pare away the waste, and enforce budget discipline. let\\'s approve the line-item veto. (applause.)and let\\'s take a partial step in this direction. most of you in this chamber didn\\'t know what was in this catch-all bill and report. over the past few weeks, we\\'ve all learned what was tucked away behind a little comma here and there. for example, there\\'s millions for items such as cranberry research, blueberry research, the study of crawfish, and the commercialization of wild flowers. and that\\'s not to mention the $5 million  or so — that — so that people from developing nations could come here to watch congress at work. (laughter.) i won\\'t even touch that. (laughter.) so tonight, i offer you this challenge. in 30 days, i will send back to you those items as rescissions, which if i had the authority to line them out, i would do so. (applause.)now, review this multibillion-dollar package that will not undercut our bipartisan budget agreement. as a matter of fact, if adopted, it will improve our deficit reduction goals. and what an example we can set; that we\\'re serious about getting our financial accounts in order. by acting and approving this plan, you have the opportunity to override a congressional process that is out of control.there is another vital reform. yes, gramm-rudman-hollings has been profoundly helpful, but let us take its goal of a balanced budget and make it permanent. let us do now what so many states do to hold down spending and what 32 state legislatures have asked us to do; let us heed the wishes of an overwhelming plurality of americans and pass a constitutional amendment that mandates a balanced budget and forces the federal government to live within its means. (applause.)reform of the budget process — including the line-item veto and balanced budget amendment — will, together with real restraint on government spending, prevent the federal budget from ever again ravaging the family budget.let\\'s ensure that the federal government never again legislates against the family and the home. last september, i signed an executive order on the family requiring that every department and agency review its activities in light of seven standards designed to promote and not harm the family. but let us make certain that the family is always at the center of the public policy process, not just in this administration but in future — all future administrations. it\\'s time for congress to consider — at the beginning — a statement of the impact that legislation will have on the basic unit of american society, the family.and speaking of the family, let\\'s turn to a matter on the mind of every american parent tonight — education. we all know the sorry story of the 60s and 70s — soaring spending, plummeting test scores — and that hopeful trend of the 80s, when we replaced an obsession with dollars with a commitment to quality, and test scores started back up. there\\'s a lesson here that we all should write on the blackboard 100 times — in a child\\'s education, money can never take the place of basics like discipline, hard work, and, yes, homework. (applause.)as a nation we do, of course, spend heavily on education — more than we spend on defense — yet across our country, governors like new jersey\\'s tom kean are giving classroom demonstrations that how we spend is as important as how much we spend. opening up the teaching profession to all qualified candidates, merit pay, so that good teachers get a\\'s as well as apples, and stronger curriculum, as secretary bennett has proposed for high schools. these imaginative reforms are making common sense the most popular new kid in america\\'s schools.how can we help? well, we can talk about and push for these reforms. but the most important thing we can do is to reaffirm that control of our schools belongs to the states, local communities and, most of all, to the parents and teachers. (applause.)my friends, some years ago, the federal government declared war on poverty, and poverty won. (laughter.) today, the federal government has 59 major welfare programs and spends more than $100 billion a year on them. what has all this money done?well, too often it has only made poverty harder to escape. federal welfare programs have created a massive social problem. with the best of intentions, government created a poverty trap that wreaks havoc on the very support system the poor need most to lift themselves out of poverty — the family. dependency has become the one enduring heirloom, passed from one generation to the next, of too many fragmented families.it is time — this may be the most radical thing i\\'ve said in seven years in this office — it\\'s time for washington to show a little humility. there are a thousand sparks of genius in 50 states and a thousand communities around the nation. it is time to nurture them and see which ones can catch fire and become guiding lights.states have begun to show us the way. they have demonstrated that successful welfare programs can be built around more effective child support enforcement practices and innovative programs requiring welfare recipients to work or prepare for work. (applause.)let us give the states even more flexibility and encourage more reforms.let\\'s start making our welfare system the first rung on america\\'s ladder of opportunity — a boost up from dependency; not a graveyard, but a birthplace of hope.and now let me turn to three other matters vital to family values and the quality of family life. the first is an untold american success story. recently, we released our annual survey of what graduating high school seniors have to say about drugs. cocaine use is declining and marijuana use was the lowest since surveying began. we can be proud that our students are \"just saying no\" to drugs. (applause.) but let us remember what this menace requires — commitment from every part of america and every single american — a commitment to a drug-free america. the war against drugs is a war of individual battles, a crusade with many heroes — including america\\'s young people, and also someone very special to me. she has helped so many of our young people to say \"no\" to drugs. nancy, much credit belongs to you, and i want to express to you your husband\\'s pride and your country\\'s thanks. (applause.) surprised you, didn\\'t i? (laughter.)well now, we come to a family issue that we must have the courage to confront. tonight, i call america — a good nation, a moral people — to charitable but realistic consideration of the terrible cost of abortion on demand. to those who say this violates a woman\\'s right to control of her own body — can they deny that now medical evidence confirms the unborn child is a living human being entitled to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness? (applause.) let us unite as a nation and protect the unborn with legislation that would stop all federal funding for abortion — and with a human life amendment making, of course, an exception where the unborn child threatens the life of the mother. our judeo-christian tradition recognizes the right of taking a life in self-defense.but with that one exception, let us look to those others in our land who cry out for children to adopt. i pledge to you tonight, i will work to remove barriers to adoption and extend full sharing in family life to millions of americans, so that children who need homes can be welcomed to families who want them and love them. (applause.)and let me add here: so many of our greatest statesmen have reminded us that spiritual values alone are essential to our nation\\'s health and vigor. the congress opens its proceedings each day, as does the supreme court, with an acknowledgment of the supreme being — yet we are denied the right to set aside in our schools a moment each day for those who wish to pray. i believe congress should pass our school prayer amendment. (applause.)now, to make sure there is a full nine-member supreme court to interpret the law, to protect the rights of all americans, i urge the senate to move quickly and decisively in confirming judge anthony kennedy to the highest court in the land and to also confirm 27 nominees now waiting to fill vacancies in the federal judiciary. (applause.)here then are our domestic priorities; yet if the congress and the administration work together, even greater opportunities lie ahead to expand a growing world economy; to continue to reduce the threat of nuclear arms and to extend the frontiers of freedom and the growth of democratic institutions.our policies consistently received the strongest support of the late congressman dan daniel of virginia. i\\'m sure all of you join me in expressing heartfelt condolences on his passing.one of the greatest contributions the united states can make to the world is to promote freedom as the key to economic growth. a creative, competitive america is the answer to a changing world, not trade wars that would close doors, create greater barriers, and destroy millions of jobs. we should always remember: protectionism is destructionism. america\\'s jobs, america\\'s growth, america\\'s future depend on trade — trade that is free, open, and fair. (applause.)this year, we have it within our power to take a major step toward a growing global economy and an expanding cycle of prosperity that reaches to all the free nations of this earth. i\\'m speaking of the historic free trade agreement negotiated between our country and canada. and i can also tell you that we\\'re determined to expand this concept, south as well as north. next month i will be traveling to mexico where trade matters will be of foremost concern. and, over the next several months, our congress and the canadian parliament can make the start of such a north american accord a reality. our goal must be a day when the free flow of trade — from the tip of tierra del fuego to the arctic circle — unites the people of the western hemisphere in a bond of mutually beneficial exchange; when all borders become what the u.s.-canadian border so long has been — a meeting place, rather than a dividing line. (applause.)this movement we see in so many places toward economic freedom is indivisible from the worldwide movement toward political freedom — and against totalitarian rule. this global democratic revolution has removed the specter — so frightening a decade ago — of democracy doomed to permanent minority status in the world. in south and central america, only a third of the people enjoyed democratic rule in 1976. today, over 90 percent of latin americans live in nations committed to democratic principles.and the resurgence of democracy is owed to these courageous people on almost every continent who have struggled to take control of their own destiny. in nicaragua, the struggle has extra meaning because that nation is so near our own borders. the recent revelations of a former high-level sandinista major, roger miranda, show us that, even as they talk peace, the communist sandinista government of nicaragua has established plans for a large 600,000-man army. yet even as these plans are made, the sandinista regime knows the tide is turning and the cause of nicaraguan freedom is riding at its crest. because of the freedom fighters, who are resisting communist rule, the sandinistas have been forced to extend some democratic rights, negotiate with church authorities, and release a few political prisoners.the focus is on the sandinistas, their promises and their actions. there is a consensus among the four central american democratic presidents that the sandinistas have not complied with the plan to bring peace and democracy to all of central america. the sandinistas again have promised reforms. their challenge is to take irreversible steps toward democracy.on wednesday, my request to sustain the freedom fighters will be submitted which reflects our mutual desire for peace, freedom, and democracy in nicaragua. i ask congress to pass this request — let us be for the people of nicaragua what lafayette, pulaski, and von steuben were for our forefathers and the cause of american independence. (applause.)so, too, in afghanistan, the freedom fighters are the key to peace. we support the mujahadeen. there can be no settlement unless all soviet troops are removed and the afghan people are allowed genuine self-determination. (applause.) i have made my views on this matter known to mr. gorbachev. but not just nicaragua or afghanistan. yes, everywhere we see a swelling freedom tide across the world — freedom fighters rising up in cambodia and angola, fighting and dying for the same democratic liberties we hold sacred. their cause is our cause. freedom.yet, even as we work to expand world freedom, we must build a safer peace and reduce the danger of nuclear war. but let\\'s have no illusions. three years of steady decline in the value of our annual defense investment have increased the risk of our most basic security interests, jeopardizing earlier hard-won goals. we must face squarely the implications of this negative trend and make adequate, stable defense spending a top goal both this year and in the future. this same concern applies to economic and security assistance programs as well. but the resolve of america and its nato allies has opened the way for unprecedented achievement in arms reduction. our recently signed inf treaty is historic because it reduces nuclear arms and establishes the most stringent verification regime in arms control history, including several forms of short-notice, on-site inspection. i submitted the treaty today, and i urge the senate to give its advice and consent to ratification of this landmark agreement. (applause.) thank you very much.in addition to the inf treaty, we\\'re within reach of an even more significant start agreement that will reduce u.s. and soviet long-range missile or strategic arsenals by half. but let me be clear — our approach is not to seek agreement for agreement\\'s sake, but to settle only for agreements that truly enhance our national security and that of our allies. we will never put our security at risk — or that of our allies — just to reach an agreement with the soviets. (applause.) no agreement is better than a bad agreement. (applause.)as i mentioned earlier, our efforts are to give future generations what we never had — a future free of nuclear terror. reduction of strategic offensive arms is one step. sdi another. our funding request for our strategic defense initiative is less than two percent of the total defense budget. sdi funding is money wisely appropriated and money well spent. (applause.) sdi has the same purpose and supports the same goals of arms reduction. it reduces the risk of war and the threat of nuclear weapons to all mankind. strategic defenses that threaten no one could offer the world a safer, more stable basis for deterrence. we must also remember that sdi is our insurance policy against a nuclear accident — a chernobyl of the sky — or an accidental launch, or some madman who might come along.we\\'ve seen such changes in the world in seven years — as totalitarianism struggles to avoid being overwhelmed by the forces of economic advance and the aspiration for human freedom, it is the free nations that are resilient and resurgent. as the global democratic revolution has put totalitarianism on the defensive, we have left behind the days of retreat — america is again a vigorous leader of the free world, a nation that acts decisively and firmly in the furtherance of her principles and vital interests. no legacy would make me more proud than leaving in place a bipartisan consensus for the cause of world freedom, a consensus that prevents a paralysis of american power from ever occurring again. (applause.)but my thoughts tonight go beyond this. and i hope you\\'ll let me end this evening with a personal reflection. you know, the world could never be quite the same again after jacob shallus, a trustworthy and dependable clerk of the pennsylvania general assembly, took his pen and engrossed those words about representative government in the preamble of our constitution. and in a quiet but final way, the course of human events was forever altered when, on a ridge overlooking the emmitsburg pike in an obscure pennsylvania town called gettysburg, lincoln spoke of our duty to government of and by the people and never letting it perish from the earth.at the start of this decade, i suggested that we lived in equally momentous times — that it is up to us now to decide whether our form of government would endure and whether history still had a place of greatness for a quiet, pleasant, greening land called america. not everything has been made perfect in seven years — nor will it be made perfect in seven times 70 years — but before us, this year and beyond, are great prospects for the cause of peace and world freedom.it means, too, that the young americans i spoke of seven years ago, as well as those who might be coming along the virginia or maryland shores this night and seeing for the first time the lights of this capital city, the lights that cast their glow on our great halls of government and the monuments to the memory of our great men — it means those young americans will find a city of hope in a land that is free.we can be proud that for them and for us as those lights along the potomac are still seen this night — signaling, as they have for nearly two centuries and as we pray god they always will, that another generation of americans has protected and passed on lovingly this place called america, this shining city on a hill, this government of, by, and for the people.thank you and god bless you.\" (applause.)'\n",
      " \"mr. speaker and mr. president, distinguished members of congress, honored guests, and fellow citizens: thank you very much for that warm reception. you know, with the big buildup this address has had, i wanted to make sure it would be a big hit, but i couldn't convince barbara to deliver it for me. [laughter] i see the speaker and the vice president are laughing. they saw what i did in japan, and they're just happy they're sitting behind me. [laughter] i mean to speak tonight of big things, of big changes and the promises they hold, and of some big problems and how, together, we can solve them and move our country forward as the undisputed leader of the age. we gather tonight at a dramatic and deeply promising time in our history and in the history of man on earth. for in the past 12 months, the world has known changes of almost biblical proportions. and even now, months after the failed coup that doomed a failed system, i'm not sure we've absorbed the full impact, the full import of what happened. but communism died this year. even as president, with the most fascinating possible vantage point, there were times when i was so busy managing progress and helping to lead change that i didn't always show the joy that was in my heart. but the biggest thing that has happened in the world in my life, in our lives, is this: by the grace of god, america won the cold war. i mean to speak this evening of the changes that can take place in our country, now that we can stop making the sacrifices we had to make when we had an avowed enemy that was a superpower. now we can look homeward even more and move to set right what needs to be set right. i will speak of those things. but let me tell you something i've been thinking these past few months. it's a kind of rollcall of honor. for the cold war didn't end; it was won. and i think of those who won it, in places like korea and vietnam. and some of them didn't come back. back then they were heroes, but this year they were victors. the long rollcall, all the g.i. joes and janes, all the ones who fought faithfully for freedom, who hit the ground and sucked the dust and knew their share of horror. this may seem frivolous, and i don't mean it so, but it's moving to me how the world saw them. the world saw not only their special valor but their special style: their rambunctious, optimistic bravery, their do-or-die unity unhampered by class or race or region. what a group we've put forth, for generations now, from the ones who wrote ``kilroy was here on the walls of the german stalags to those who left signs in the iraqi desert that said, ``i saw elvis. what a group of kids we've sent out into the world. and there's another to be singled out, though it may seem inelegant, and i mean a mass of people called the american taxpayer. no one ever thinks to thank the people who pay a country's bill or an alliance's bill. but for half a century now, the american people have shouldered the burden and paid taxes that were higher than they would have been to support a defense that was bigger than it would have been if imperial communism had never existed. but it did; doesn't anymore. and here's a fact i wouldn't mind the world acknowledging: the american taxpayer bore the brunt of the burden and deserves a hunk of the glory. so now, for the first time in 35 years, our strategic bombers stand down. no longer are they on 'round-the-clock alert. tomorrow our children will go to school and study history and how plants grow. and they won't have, as my children did, air raid drills in which they crawl under their desks and cover their heads in case of nuclear war. my grandchildren don't have to do that and won't have the bad dreams children had once, in decades past. there are still threats. but the long, drawn-out dread is over. a year ago tonight, i spoke to you at a moment of high peril. american forces had just unleashed operation desert storm. and after 40 days in the desert skies and 4 days on the ground, the men and women of america's armed forces and our allies accomplished the goals that i declared and that you endorsed: we liberated kuwait. soon after, the arab world and israel sat down to talk seriously and comprehensively about peace, an historic first. and soon after that, at christmas, the last american hostages came home. our policies were vindicated. much good can come from the prudent use of power. and much good can come of this: a world once divided into two armed camps now recognizes one sole and preeminent power, the united states of america. and they regard this with no dread. for the world trusts us with power, and the world is right. they trust us to be fair and restrained. they trust us to be on the side of decency. they trust us to do what's right. i use those words advisedly. a few days after the war began, i received a telegram from joanne speicher, the wife of the first pilot killed in the gulf, lieutenant commander scott speicher. even in her grief, she wanted me to know that some day when her children were old enough, she would tell them ``that their father went away to war because it was the right thing to do. and she said it all: it was the right thing to do. and we did it together. there were honest differences right here in this chamber. but when the war began, you put partisanship aside, and we supported our troops. this is still a time for pride, but this is no time to boast. for problems face us, and we must stand together once again and solve them and not let our country down. two years ago, i began planning cuts in military spending that reflected the changes of the new era. but now, this year, with imperial communism gone, that process can be accelerated. tonight i can tell you of dramatic changes in our strategic nuclear force. these are actions we are taking on our own because they are the right thing to do. after completing 20 planes for which we have begun procurement, we will shut down further production of the b - 2 bombers. we will cancel the small icbm program. we will cease production of new warheads for our sea-based ballistic missiles. we will stop all new production of the peacekeeper missile. and we will not purchase any more advanced cruise missiles. this weekend i will meet at camp david with boris yeltsin of the russian federation. i've informed president yeltsin that if the commonwealth, the former soviet union, will eliminate all land-based multiple-warhead ballistic missiles, i will do the following: we will eliminate all peacekeeper missiles. we will reduce the number of warheads on minuteman missiles to one and reduce the number of warheads on our sea-based missiles by about one-third. and we will convert a substantial portion of our strategic bombers to primarily conventional use. president yeltsin's early response has been very positive, and i expect our talks at camp david to be fruitful. i want you to know that for half a century, american presidents have longed to make such decisions and say such words. but even in the midst of celebration, we must keep caution as a friend. for the world is still a dangerous place. only the dead have seen the end of conflict. and though yesterday's challenges are behind us, tomorrow's are being born. the secretary of defense recommended these cuts after consultation with the joint chiefs of staff. and i make them with confidence. but do not misunderstand me. the reductions i have approved will save us an additional $50 billion over the next 5 years. by 1997, we will have cut defense by 30 percent since i took office. these cuts are deep, and you must know my resolve: this deep, and no deeper. to do less would be insensible to progress, but to do more would be ignorant of history. we must not go back to the days of ``the hollow army. we cannot repeat the mistakes made twice in this century when armistice was followed by recklessness and defense was purged as if the world were permanently safe. i remind you this evening that i have asked for your support in funding a program to protect our country from limited nuclear missile attack. we must have this protection because too many people in too many countries have access to nuclear arms. and i urge you again to pass the strategic defense initiative, sdi. there are those who say that now we can turn away from the world, that we have no special role, no special place. but we are the united states of america, the leader of the west that has become the leader of the world. and as long as i am president, i will continue to lead in support of freedom everywhere, not out of arrogance, not out of altruism, but for the safety and security of our children. this is a fact: strength in the pursuit of peace is no vice; isolationism in the pursuit of security is no virtue. and now to our troubles at home. they're not all economic; the primary problem is our economy. there are some good signs. inflation, that thief, is down. and interest rates are down. but unemployment is too high, some industries are in trouble, and growth is not what it should be. let me tell you right from the start and right from the heart, i know we're in hard times. but i know something else: this will not stand. in this chamber, in this chamber we can bring the same courage and sense of common purpose to the economy that we brought to desert storm. and we can defeat hard times together. i believe you'll help. one reason is that you're patriots, and you want the best for your country. and i believe that in your hearts you want to put partisanship aside and get the job done because it's the right thing to do. the power of america rests in a stirring but simple idea, that people will do great things if only you set them free. well, we're going to set the economy free. for if this age of miracles and wonders has taught us anything, it's that if we can change the world we can change america. we must encourage investment. we must make it easier for people to invest money and create new products, new industries, and new jobs. we must clear away the obstacles to growth: high taxes, high regulation, redtape, and yes, wasteful government spending. none of this will happen with a snap of the fingers, but it will happen. and the test of a plan isn't whether it's called new or dazzling. the american people aren't impressed by gimmicks; they're smarter on this score than all of us in this room. the only test of a plan is: is it sound, and will it work? we must have a short-term plan to address our immediate needs and heat up the economy. and then we need a longer term plan to keep combustion going and to guarantee our place in the world economy. there are certain things that a president can do without congress, and i'm going to do them. i have, this evening, asked major cabinet departments and federal agencies to institute a 90-day moratorium on any new federal regulations that could hinder growth. in those 90 days, major departments and agencies will carry out a top-to-bottom review of all regulations, old and new, to stop the ones that will hurt growth and speed up those that will help growth. further, for the untold number of hard-working, responsible american workers and business men and women who've been forced to go without needed bank loans, the banking credit crunch must end. i won't neglect my responsibility for sound regulations that serve the public good, but regulatory overkill must be stopped. and i've instructed our government regulators to stop it. i have directed cabinet departments and federal agencies to speed up progrowth expenditures as quickly as possible. this should put an extra $10 billion into the economy in the next 6 months. and our new transportation bill provides more than $150 billion for construction and maintenance projects that are vital to our growth and well-being. and that means jobs building roads, jobs building bridges, and jobs building railways. and i have, this evening, directed the secretary of the treasury to change the federal tax withholding tables. with this change, millions of americans from whom the government withholds more than necessary can now choose to have the government withhold less from their paychecks. something tells me a number of taxpayers may take us up on this one. this initiative could return about $25 billion back into our economy over the next 12 months, money people can use to help pay for clothing, college, or to get a new car. finally, working with the federal reserve, we will continue to support monetary policy that keeps both interest rates and inflation down. now, these are the things i can do. and now, members of congress, let me tell you what you can do for your country. you must pass the other elements of my plan to meet our economic needs. everyone knows that investment spurs recovery. i am proposing this evening a change in the alternative minimum tax and the creation of a new 15-percent investment tax allowance. this will encourage businesses to accelerate investment and bring people back to work. real estate has led our economy out of almost all the tough times we've ever had. once building starts, carpenters and plumbers work; people buy homes and take out mortgages. my plan would modify the passive loss rule for active real estate developers. and it would make it easier for pension plans to purchase real estate. for those americans who dream of buying a first home but who can't quite afford it, my plan would allow first-time homebuyers to withdraw savings from ira's without penalty and provide a $5,000 tax credit for the first purchase of that home. and finally, my immediate plan calls on congress to give crucial help to people who own a home, to everyone who has a business or a farm or a single investment. this time, at this hour, i cannot take no for an answer. you must cut the capital gains tax on the people of our country. never has an issue been more demagogued by its opponents. but the demagogs are wrong. they are wrong, and they know it. sixty percent of the people who benefit from lower capital gains have incomes under $50,000. a cut in the capital gains tax increases jobs and helps just about everyone in our country. and so, i'm asking you to cut the capital gains tax to a maximum of 15.4 percent. i'll tell you, those of you who say, ``oh, no, someone who's comfortable may benefit from that, you kind of remind me of the old definition of the puritan who couldn't sleep at night, worrying that somehow, someone somewhere was out having a good time. [laughter] the opponents of this measure and those who have authored various so-called soak-the-rich bills that are floating around this chamber should be reminded of something: when they aim at the big guy, they usually hit the little guy. and maybe it's time that stopped. this, then, is my short-term plan. your part, members of congress, requires enactment of these commonsense proposals that will have a strong effect on the economy without breaking the budget agreement and without raising tax rates. while my plan is being passed and kicking in, we've got to care for those in trouble today. i have provided for up to $4.4 billion in my budget to extend federal unemployment benefits. and i ask for congressional action right away. and i thank the committee. [applause] well, at last. let's be frank. let's be frank. let me level with you. i know and you know that my plan is unveiled in a political season. [laughter] i know and you know that everything i propose will be viewed by some in merely partisan terms. but i ask you to know what is in my heart. and my aim is to increase our nation's good. i'm doing what i think is right, and i am proposing what i know will help. i pride myself that i'm a prudent man, and i believe that patience is a virtue. but i understand that politics is, for some, a game and that sometimes the game is to stop all progress and then decry the lack of improvement. [laughter] but let me tell you: far more important than my political future and far more important than yours is the well-being of our country. members of this chamber are practical people, and i know you won't resent some practical advice. when people put their party's fortunes, whatever the party, whatever side of this aisle, before the public good, they court defeat not only for their country but for themselves. and they will certainly deserve it. i submit my plan tomorrow, and i'm asking you to pass it by march 20th. and i ask the american people to let you know they want this action by march 20th. from the day after that, if it must be, the battle is joined. and you know, when principle is at stake i relish a good, fair fight. i said my plan has two parts, and it does. and it's the second part that is the heart of the matter. for it's not enough to get an immediate burst. we need long-term improvement in our economic position. we all know that the key to our economic future is to ensure that america continues as an economic leader of the world. we have that in our power. here, then, is my long-term plan to guarantee our future. first, trade: we will work to break down the walls that stop world trade. we will work to open markets everywhere. and in our major trade negotiations, i will continue pushing to eliminate tariffs and subsidies that damage america's farmers and workers. and we'll get more good american jobs within our own hemisphere through the north american free trade agreement and through the enterprise for the americas initiative. but changes are here, and more are coming. the workplace of the future will demand more highly skilled workers than ever, more people who are computer-literate, highly educated. we must be the world's leader in education. and we must revolutionize america's schools. my america 2000 strategy will help us reach that goal. my plan will give parents more choice, give teachers more flexibility, and help communities create new american schools. thirty states across the nation have established america 2000 programs. hundreds of cities and towns have joined in. now congress must join this great movement: pass my proposals for new american schools. that was my second long-term proposal, and here's my third: we must make commonsense investments that will help us compete, long-term, in the marketplace. we must encourage research and development. my plan is to make the r&d tax credit permanent and to provide record levels of support, over $76 billion this year alone, for people who will explore the promise of emerging technologies. fourth, we must do something about crime and drugs. it is time for a major, renewed investment in fighting violent street crime. it saps our strength and hurts our faith in our society and in our future together. surely a tired woman on her way to work at 6 in the morning on a subway deserves the right to get there safely. and surely it's true that everyone who changes his or her life because of crime, from those afraid to go out at night to those afraid to walk in the parks they pay for, surely these people have been denied a basic civil right. it is time to restore it. congress, pass my comprehensive crime bill. it is tough on criminals and supportive of police, and it has been languishing in these hallowed halls for years now. pass it. help your country. fifth, i ask you tonight to fund our hope housing proposal and to pass my enterprise zone legislation which will get businesses into the inner city. we must empower the poor with the pride that comes from owning a home, getting a job, becoming a part of things. my plan would encourage real estate construction by extending tax incentives for mortgage revenue bonds and low-income housing. and i ask tonight for record expenditures for the program that helps children born into want move into excellence, head start. step six, we must reform our health care system. for this, too, bears on whether or not we can compete in the world. american health costs have been exploding. this year america will spend over $800 billion on health, and that is expected to grow to 1.6 trillion by the end of the decade. we simply cannot afford this. the cost of health care shows up not only in your family budget but in the price of everything we buy and everything we sell. when health coverage for a fellow on an assembly line costs thousands of dollars, the cost goes into the products he makes, and you pay the bill. we must make a choice. now, some pretend we can have it both ways. they call it ``play or pay, but that expensive approach is unstable. it will mean higher taxes, fewer jobs, and eventually a system under complete government control. really, there are only two options. and we can move toward a nationalized system, a system which will restrict patient choice in picking a doctor and force the government to ration services arbitrarily. and what we'll get is patients in long lines, indifferent service, and a huge new tax burden. or we can reform our own private health care system, which still gives us, for all its flaws, the best quality health care in the world. well, let's build on our strengths. my plan provides insurance security for all americans while preserving and increasing the idea of choice. we make basic health insurance affordable for all low-income people not now covered, and we do it by providing a health insurance tax credit of up to $3,750 for each low-income family. and the middle class gets help, too. and by reforming the health insurance market, my plan assures that americans will have access to basic health insurance even if they change jobs or develop serious health problems. we must bring costs under control, preserve quality, preserve choice, and reduce the people's nagging daily worry about health insurance. my plan, the details of which i'll announce very shortly, does just that. seventh, we must get the federal deficit under control. we now have, in law, enforceable spending caps and a requirement that we pay for the programs we create. there are those in congress who would ease that discipline now. but i cannot let them do it, and i won't. my plan would freeze all domestic discretionary budget authority, which means no more next year than this year. i will not tamper with social security, but i would put real caps on the growth of uncontrolled spending. and i would also freeze federal domestic government employment. and with the help of congress, my plan will get rid of 246 programs that don't deserve federal funding. some of them have noble titles, but none of them is indispensable. we can get rid of each and every one of them. you know, it's time we rediscovered a home truth the american people have never forgotten: this government is too big and spends too much. and i call upon congress to adopt a measure that will help put an end to the annual ritual of filling the budget with pork barrel appropriations. every year, the press has a field day making fun of outrageous examples: a lawrence welk museum, research grants for belgian endive. we all know how these things get into the budget, and maybe you need someone to help you say no. i know how to say it, and i know what i need to make it stick. give me the same thing 43 governors have, the line-item veto, and let me help you control spending. we must put an end to unfinanced federal government mandates. these are the requirements congress puts on our cities, counties, and states without supplying the money. if congress passes a mandate, it should be forced to pay for it and balance the cost with savings elsewhere. after all, a mandate just increases someone else's burden, and that means higher taxes at the state and local level. step eight, congress should enact the bold reform proposals that are still awaiting congressional action: bank reform, civil justice reform, tort reform, and my national energy strategy. and finally, we must strengthen the family because it is the family that has the greatest bearing on our future. when barbara holds an aids baby in her arms and reads to children, she's saying to every person in this country: family matters. and i am announcing tonight a new commission on america's urban families. i've asked missouri's governor john ashcroft to be chairman, former dallas mayor annette strauss to be cochair. you know, i had mayors, the leading mayors from the league of cities, in the other day at the white house, and they told me something striking. they said that every one of them, republican or democrat, agreed on one thing, that the major cause of the problems of the cities is the dissolution of the family. they asked for this commission, and they were right to ask because it's time to determine what we can do to keep families together, strong and sound. there's one thing we can do right away: ease the burden of rearing a child. i ask you tonight to raise the personal exemption by $500 per child for every family. for a family with four kids, that's an increase of $2,000. this is a good start in the right direction, and it's what we can afford. it's time to allow families to deduct the interest they pay on student loans. i am asking you to do just that. and i'm asking you to allow people to use money from their ira's to pay medical and education expenses, all without penalties. and i'm asking for more. ask american parents what they dislike about how things are going in our country, and chances are good that pretty soon they'll get to welfare. americans are the most generous people on earth. but we have to go back to the insight of franklin roosevelt who, when he spoke of what became the welfare program, warned that it must not become ``a narcotic and a ``subtle destroyer of the spirit. welfare was never meant to be a lifestyle. it was never meant to be a habit. it was never supposed to be passed from generation to generation like a legacy. it's time to replace the assumptions of the welfare state and help reform the welfare system. states throughout the country are beginning to operate with new assumptions that when able-bodied people receive government assistance, they have responsibilities to the taxpayer: a responsibility to seek work, education, or job training; a responsibility to get their lives in order; a responsibility to hold their families together and refrain from having children out of wedlock; and a responsibility to obey the law. we are going to help this movement. often, state reform requires waiving certain federal regulations. i will act to make that process easier and quicker for every state that asks for our help. i want to add, as we make these changes, we work together to improve this system, that our intention is not scapegoating or finger-pointing. if you read the papers and watch tv, you know there's been a rise these days in a certain kind of ugliness: racist comments, anti-semitism, an increased sense of division. really, this is not us. this is not who we are. and this is not acceptable. and so, you have my plan for america. and i'm asking for big things, but i believe in my heart you'll do what's right. you know, it's kind of an american tradition to show a certain skepticism toward our democratic institutions. i myself have sometimes thought the aging process could be delayed if it had to make its way through congress. [laughter] you will deliberate, and you will discuss, and that is fine. but, my friends, the people cannot wait. they need help now. there's a mood among us. people are worried. there's been talk of decline. someone even said our workers are lazy and uninspired. and i thought: really? you go tell neil armstrong standing on the moon. tell the men and women who put him there. tell the american farmer who feeds his country and the world. tell the men and women of desert storm. moods come and go, but greatness endures. ours does. and maybe for a moment it's good to remember what, in the dailiness of our lives, we forget: we are still and ever the freest nation on earth, the kindest nation on earth, the strongest nation on earth. and we have always risen to the occasion. and we are going to lift this nation out of hard times inch by inch and day by day, and those who would stop us had better step aside. because i look at hard times, and i make this vow: this will not stand. and so, we move on together, a rising nation, the once and future miracle that is still, this night, the hope of the world. thank you. god bless you, and god bless our beloved country. thank you very, very much. \"\n",
      " 'mr. president, mr. speaker, members of the house and the senate, distinguished americans here as visitors in this chamber, as am i. it is nice to have a fresh excuse for giving a long speech. [laughter] when presidents speak to congress and the nation from this podium, typically they comment on the full range in challenges and opportunities that face the united states. but this is not an ordinary time, and for all the many tasks that require our attention, i believe tonight one calls on us to focus, to unite, and to act. and that is our economy. for more than anything else, our task tonight as americans is to make our economy thrive again. let me begin by saying that it has been too long, at least three decades, since a president has come and challenged americans to join him on a great national journey, not merely to consume the bounty of today but to invest for a much greater one tomorrow. like individuals, nations must ultimately decide how they wish to conduct themselves, how they wish to be thought of by those with whom they live, and later, how they wish to be judged by history. like every individual man and woman, nations must decide whether they are prepared to rise to the occasions history presents them. we have always been a people of youthful energy and daring spirit. and at this historic moment, as communism has fallen, as freedom is spreading around the world, as a global economy is taking shape before our eyes, americans have called for change. and now it is up to those of us in this room to deliver for them. our nation needs a new direction. tonight i present to you a comprehensive plan to set our nation on that new course. i believe we will find our new direction in the basic old values that brought us here over the last two centuries: a commitment to opportunity, to individual responsibility, to community, to work, to family, and to faith. we must now break the habits of both political parties and say there can be no more something for nothing and admit frankly that we are all in this together. the conditions which brought us as a nation to this point are well-known: two decades of low productivity, growth, and stagnant wages; persistent unemployment and underemployment; years of huge government deficits and declining investment in our future; exploding health care costs and lack of coverage for millions of americans; legions of poor children; education and job training opportunities inadequate to the demands of this tough, global economy. for too long we have drifted without a strong sense of purpose or responsibility or community. and our political system so often has seemed paralyzed by special interest groups, by partisan bickering, and by the sheer complexity of our problems. i believe we can do better because we remain the greatest nation on earth, the world\\'s strongest economy, the world\\'s only military superpower. if we have the vision, the will, and the heart to make the changes we must, we can still enter the 21st century with possibilities our parents could not even have imagined and enter it having secured the american dream for ourselves and for future generations. i well remember 12 years ago president reagan stood at this very podium and told you and the american people that if our national debt were stacked in thousand-dollar bills, the stack would reach 67 miles into space. well, today that stack would reach 267 miles. i tell you this not to assign blame for this problem. there is plenty of blame to go around in both branches of the government and both parties. the time has come for the blame to end. i did not seek this office to place blame. i come here tonight to accept responsibility, and i want you to accept responsibility with me. and if we do right by this country, i do not care who gets the credit for it. the plan i offer you has four fundamental components. first, it shifts our emphasis in public and private spending from consumption to investment, initially by jumpstarting the economy in the short term and investing in our people, their jobs, and their incomes over the long run. second, it changes the rhetoric of the past into the actions of the present by honoring work and families in every part of our public decision-making. third, it substantially reduces the federal deficit honestly and credibly by using in the beginning the most conservative estimates of government revenues, not, as the executive branch has done so often in the past, using the most optimistic ones. and finally, it seeks to earn the trust of the american people by paying for these plans first with cuts in government waste and efficiency; second, with cuts, not gimmicks, in government spending; and by fairness, for a change, in the way additional burdens are borne. tonight i want to talk with you about what government can do because i believe government must do more. but let me say first that the real engine of economic growth in this country is the private sector, and second, that each of us must be an engine of growth and change. the truth is that as government creates more opportunity in this new and different time, we must also demand more responsibility in turn. our immediate priority must be to create jobs, create jobs now. some people say, \"well, we\\'re in a recovery, and we don\\'t have to do that.\" well, we all hope we\\'re in a recovery, but we\\'re sure not creating new jobs. and there\\'s no recovery worth its salt that doesn\\'t put the american people back to work. to create jobs and guarantee a strong recovery, i call on congress to enact an immediate package of jobs investments of over $30 billion to put people to work now, to create a half a million jobs: jobs to rebuild our highways and airports, to renovate housing, to bring new life to rural communities, and spread hope and opportunity among our nation\\'s youth. especially i want to emphasize, after the events of last year in los angeles and the countless stories of despair in our cities and in our poor rural communities, this proposal will create almost 700,000 new summer jobs for displaced, unemployed young people alone this summer. and tonight i invite america\\'s business leaders to join us in this effort so that together we can provide over one million summer jobs in cities and poor rural areas for our young people. second, our plan looks beyond today\\'s business cycle because our aspirations extend into the next century. the heart of this plan deals with the long term. it is an investment program designed to increase public and private investment in areas critical to our economic future. and it has a deficit reduction program that will increase the savings available for the private sector to invest, will lower interest rates, will decrease the percentage of the federal budget claimed by interest payments, and decrease the risk of financial market disruptions that could adversely affect our economy. over the long run, all this will bring us a higher rate of economic growth, improved productivity, more high-quality jobs, and an improved economic competitive position in the world. in order to accomplish both increased investment and deficit reduction, something no american government has ever been called upon to do at the same time before, spending must be cut and taxes must be raised. the spending cuts i recommend were carefully thought through in a way to minimize any adverse economic impact, to capture the peace dividend for investment purposes, and to switch the balance in the budget from consumption to more investment. the tax increases and the spending cuts were both designed to assure that the cost of this historic program to face and deal with our problems will be borne by those who could readily afford it the most. our plan is designed, furthermore, and perhaps in some ways most importantly, to improve the health of american business through lower interest rates, more incentives to invest, and better trained workers. because small business has created such a high percentage of all the new jobs in our nation over the last 10 or 15 years, our plan includes the boldest targeted incentives for small business in history. we propose a permanent investment tax credit for the smallest firms in this country, with revenues of under $5 million. that\\'s about 90 percent of the firms in america, employing about 40 percent of the work force but creating a big majority of the net new jobs for more than a decade. and we propose new rewards for entrepreneurs who take new risks. we propose to give small business access to all the new technologies of our time. and we propose to attack this credit crunch which has denied small business the credit they need to flourish and prosper. with a new network of community development banks and $1 billion to make the dream of enterprise zones real, we propose to bring new hope and new jobs to storefronts and factories from south boston to south texas to south central los angeles. this plan invests in our roads, our bridges, our transit systems, in high-speed railways and high-tech information systems. and it provides the most ambitious environmental cleanup in partnership with state and local government of our time, to put people to work and to preserve the environment for our future. standing as we are on the edge of a new century, we know that economic growth depends as never before on opening up new markets overseas and expanding the volume of world trade. and so, we will insist on fair trade rules in international markets as a part of a national economic strategy to expand trade, including the successful completion of the latest round of world trade talks and the successful completion of a north american free trade agreement with appropriate safeguards for our workers and for the environment. at the same time—and i say this to you in both parties and across america tonight, all the people who are listening—it is not enough to pass a budget or even to have a trade agreement. this world is changing so fast that we must have aggressive, targeted attempts to create the high-wage jobs of the future. that\\'s what all our competitors are doing. we must give special attention to those critical industries that are going to explode in the 21st century but that are in trouble in america today, like aerospace. we must provide special assistance to areas and to workers displaced by cuts in the defense budget and by other unavoidable economic dislocations. and again i will say we must do this together. i pledge to you that i will do my best to see that business and labor and government work together for a change. but all of our efforts to strengthen the economy will fail—let me say this again; i feel so strongly about this—all of our efforts to strengthen the economy will fail unless we also take this year, not next year, not 5 years from now but this year, bold steps to reform our health care system. in 1992, we spent 14 percent of our income on health care, more than 30 percent more than any other country in the world, and yet we were the only advanced nation that did not provide a basic package of health care benefits to all of its citizens. unless we change the present pattern, 50 percent of the growth in the deficit between now and the year 2000 will be in health care costs. by the year 2000 almost 20 percent of our income will be in health care. our families will never be secure, our businesses will never be strong, and our government will never again be fully solvent until we tackle the health care crisis. we must do it this year. the combination of the rising cost of care and the lack of care and the fear of losing care are endangering the security and the very lives of millions of our people. and they are weakening our economy every day. reducing health care costs can liberate literally hundreds of billions of dollars for new investment in growth and jobs. bringing health costs in line with inflation would do more for the private sector in this country than any tax cut we could give and any spending program we could promote. reforming health care over the long run is critically essential to reducing not only our deficit but to expanding investment in america. later this spring, after the first lady and the many good people who are helping her all across the country complete their work, i will deliver to congress a comprehensive plan for health care reform that finally will bring costs under control and provide security to all of our families, so that no one will be denied the coverage they need but so that our economic future will not be compromised either. we\\'ll have to root out fraud and overcharges and make sure that paperwork no longer chokes your doctor. we\\'ll have to maintain the highest american standards and the right to choose in a system that is the world\\'s finest for all those who can access it. but first we must make choices. we must choose to give the american people the quality they demand and deserve with a system that will not bankrupt the country or further drive more americans into agony. let me further say that i want to work with all of you on this. i realize this is a complicated issue. but we must address it. and i believe if there is any chance that republicans and democrats who disagree on taxes and spending or anything else could agree on one thing, surely we can all look at these numbers and go home and tell our people the truth. we cannot continue these spending patterns in public or private dollars for health care for less and less and less every year. we can do better. and i will work to do better. perhaps the most fundamental change the new direction i propose offers is its focus on the future and its investment which i seek in our children. each day we delay really making a commitment to our children carries a dear cost. half of the 2-year-olds in this country today don\\'t receive the immunizations they need against deadly diseases. our plan will provide them for every eligible child. and we know now that we will save $10 later for every $1 we spend by eliminating preventable childhood diseases. that\\'s a good investment no matter how you measure it. i recommend that the women, infants, and children\\'s nutrition program be expanded so that every expectant mother who needs the help gets it. we all know that head start, a program that prepares children for school, is a success story. we all know that it saves money. but today it just reaches barely over one-third of all the eligible children. under this plan, every eligible child will be able to get a head start. this is not just the right thing to do; it is the smart thing to do. for every dollar we invest today, we\\'ll save $3 tomorrow. we have to start thinking about tomorrow. (i\\'ve heard that somewhere before.) [laughter] we have to ask more in our schools of our students, our teachers, our principals, our parents. yes, we must give them the resources they need to meet high standards, but we must also use the authority and the influence and the funding of the education department to promote strategies that really work in learning. money alone is not enough. we have to do what really works to increase learning in our schools. we have to recognize that all of our high school graduates need some further education in order to be competitive in this global economy. so we have to establish a partnership between businesses and education and the government for apprenticeship programs in every state in this country to give our people the skills they need. lifelong learning must benefit not just young high school graduates but workers, too, throughout their career. the average 18-year-old today will change jobs seven times in a lifetime. we have done a lot in this country on worker training in the last few years, but the system is too fractured. we must develop a unified, simplified, sensible, streamlined worker-training program so that workers receive the training they need regardless of why they lost their jobs or whether they simply need to learn something new to keep them. we have got to do better on this. and finally, i propose a program that got a great response from the american people all across this country last year: a program of national service to make college loans available to all americans and to challenge them at the same time to give something back to their country as teachers or police officers or community service workers; to give them the option to pay the loans back, but at tax time so they can\\'t beat the bill, but to encourage them instead to pay it back by making their country stronger and making their country better and giving us the benefit of their knowledge. a generation ago when president kennedy proposed and the united states congress embraced the peace corps, it defined the character of a whole generation of americans committed to serving people around the world. in this national service program, we will provide more than twice as many slots for people before they go to college to be in national service than ever served in the peace corps. this program could do for this generation of members of congress what the land grant college act did and what the gi bill did for former congressmen. in the future, historians who got their education through the national service loan will look back on you and thank you for giving america a new lease on life, if you meet this challenge. if we believe in jobs and we believe in learning, we must believe in rewarding work. if we believe in restoring the values that make america special, we must believe that there is dignity in all work, and there must be dignity for all workers. to those who care for our sick, who tend our children, who do our most difficult and tiring jobs, the new direction i propose will make this solemn, simple commitment: by expanding the refundable earned-income tax credit, we will make history. we will reward the work of millions of working poor americans by realizing the principle that if you work 40 hours a week and you\\'ve got a child in the house, you will no longer be in poverty. later this year, we will offer a plan to end welfare as we know it. i have worked on this issue for the better part of a decade. and i know from personal conversations with many people that no one, no one wants to change the welfare system as badly as those who are trapped in it. i want to offer the people on welfare the education, the training, the child care, the health care they need to get back on their feet, but say after 2 years they must get back to work, too, in private business if possible, in public service if necessary. we have to end welfare as a way of life and make it a path to independence and dignity. our next great goal should be to strengthen our families. i compliment the congress for passing the family and medical leave act as a good first step, but it is time to do more. this plan will give this country the toughest child support enforcement system it has ever had. it is time to demand that people take responsibility for the children they bring in this world. and i ask you to help to protect our families against the violent crime which terrorizes our people and which tears our communities apart. we must pass a tough crime bill. i support not only the bill which didn\\'t quite make it to the president\\'s desk last year but also an initiative to put 100,000 more police officers on the street, to provide boot camps for first-time nonviolent offenders for more space for the hardened criminals in jail. and i support an initiative to do what we can to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. let me say this. i will make you this bargain: if you will pass the brady bill, i\\'ll sure sign it. let me say now, we should move to the harder parts. i think it is clear to every american, including every member of congress of both parties, that the confidence of the people who pay our bills in our institutions in washington is not high. we must restore it. we must begin again to make government work for ordinary taxpayers, not simply for organized interest groups. and that beginning must start with real political reform. i am asking the united states congress to pass a real campaign finance reform bill this year. i ask you to increase the participation of the american people by passing the motor voter bill promptly. i ask you to deal with the undue influence of special interests by passing a bill to end the tax deduction for lobbying and to act quickly to require all the people who lobby you to register as lobbyists by passing the lobbying registration bill. believe me, they were cheering that last section at home. i believe lobby reform and campaign finance reform are a sure path to increased popularity for republicans and democrats alike because it says to the voters back home, \"this is your house. this is your senate. we\\'re your hired hands, and every penny we draw is your money.\" next, to revolutionize government we have to ensure that we live within our means, and that should start at the top and with the white house. in the last few days i have announced a cut in the white house staff of 25 percent, saving approximately $10 million. i have ordered administrative cuts in budgets of agencies and departments. i have cut the federal bureaucracy, or will over the next 4 years, by approximately 100,000 positions, for a combined savings of $9 billion. it is time for government to demonstrate, in the condition we\\'re in, that we can be as frugal as any household in america. and that\\'s why i also want to congratulate the congress. i noticed the announcement of the leadership today that congress is taking similar steps to cut its costs. i think that is important. i think it will send a very clear signal to the american people. but if we really want to cut spending, we\\'re going to have to do more, and some of it will be difficult. tonight i call for an across-the-board freeze in federal government salaries for one year. and thereafter, during this 4-year period, i recommend that salaries rise at one point lower than the cost of living allowance normally involved in federal pay increases. next, i recommend that we make 150 specific budget cuts, as you know, and that all those who say we should cut more be as specific as i have been.finally, let me say to my friends on both sides of the aisle, it is not enough simply to cut government; we have to rethink the whole way it works. when i became president i was amazed at just the way the white house worked, in ways that added lots of money to what taxpayers had to pay, outmoded ways that didn\\'t take maximum advantage of technology and didn\\'t do things that any business would have done years ago to save taxpayers\\' money. so i want to bring a new spirit of innovation into every government department. i want to push education reform, as i said, not just to spend more money but to really improve learning. some things work, and some things don\\'t. we ought to be subsidizing the things that work and discouraging the things that don\\'t. i\\'d like to use that superfund to clean up pollution for a change and not just pay lawyers. in the aftermath of all the difficulties with the savings and loans, we must use federal bank regulators to protect the security and safety of our financial institutions, but they should not be used to continue the credit crunch and to stop people from making sensible loans. i\\'d like for us to not only have welfare reform but to reexamine the whole focus of all of our programs that help people, to shift them from entitlement programs to empowerment programs. in the end we want people not to need us anymore. i think that\\'s important. but in the end we have to get back to the deficit. for years there\\'s been a lot of talk about it but very few credible efforts to deal with it. and now i understand why, having dealt with the real numbers for 4 weeks. but i believe this plan does; it tackles the budget deficit seriously and over the long term. it puts in place one of the biggest deficit reductions and one of the biggest changes in federal priorities, from consumption to investment, in the history of this country at the same time over the next 4 years. let me say to all the people watching us tonight who will ask me these questions beginning tomorrow as i go around the country and who\\'ve asked it in the past: we\\'re not cutting the deficit just because experts say it\\'s the thing to do or because it has some intrinsic merit. we have to cut the deficit because the more we spend paying off the debt, the less tax dollars we have to invest in jobs and education and the future of this country. and the more money we take out of the pool of available savings, the harder it is for people in the private sector to borrow money at affordable interest rates for a college loan for their children, for a home mortgage, or to start a new business. that\\'s why we\\'ve got to reduce the debt, because it is crowding out other activities that we ought to be engaged in and that the american people ought to be engaged in. we cut the deficit so that our children will be able to buy a home, so that our companies can invest in the future and in retraining their workers, so that our government can make the kinds of investments we need to be a stronger and smarter and safer nation. if we don\\'t act now, you and i might not even recognize this government 10 years from now. if we just stay with the same trends of the last 4 years, by the end of the decade the deficit will be $635 billion a year, almost 80 percent of our gross domestic product. and paying interest on that debt will be the costliest government program of all. we\\'ll still be the world\\'s largest debtor. and when members of congress come here, they\\'ll be devoting over 20 cents on the dollar to interest payments, more than half of the budget to health care and to other entitlements. and you\\'ll come here and deliberate and argue over 6 or 7 cents on the dollar, no matter what america\\'s problems are. we will not be able to have the independence we need to chart the future that we must. and we\\'ll be terribly dependent on foreign funds for a large portion of our investment. this budget plan, by contrast, will by 1997 cut $140 billion in that year alone from the deficit, a real spending cut, a real revenue increase, a real deficit reduction, using the independent numbers of the congressional budget office. [laughter] well, you can laugh, my fellow republicans, but i\\'ll point out that the congressional budget office was normally more conservative in what was going to happen and closer to right than previous presidents have been. i did this so that we could argue about priorities with the same set of numbers. i did this so that no one could say i was estimating my way out of this difficulty. i did this because if we can agree together on the most prudent revenues we\\'re likely to get if the recovery stays and we do right things economically, then it will turn out better for the american people than we say. in the last 12 years, because there were differences over the revenue estimates, you and i know that both parties were given greater elbow room for irresponsibility. this is tightening the rein on the democrats as well as the republicans. let\\'s at least argue about the same set of numbers so the american people will think we\\'re shooting straight with them. as i said earlier, my recommendation makes more than 150 difficult reductions to cut the federal spending by a total of $246 billion. we are eliminating programs that are no longer needed, such as nuclear power research and development. we\\'re slashing subsidies and canceling wasteful projects. but many of these programs were justified in their time, and a lot of them are difficult for me to recommend reductions in, some really tough ones for me personally. i recommend that we reduce interest subsidies to the rural electric administration. that\\'s a difficult thing for me to recommend. but i think that i cannot exempt the things that exist in my state or in my experience, if i ask you to deal with things that are difficult for you to deal with. we\\'re going to have to have no sacred cows except the fundamental abiding interest of the american people. i have to say that we all know our government has been just great at building programs. the time has come to show the american people that we can limit them too; that we can not only start things, that we can actually stop things. about the defense budget, i raise a hope and a caution. as we restructure our military forces to meet the new threats of the post-cold-war world, it is true that we can responsibly reduce our defense budget. and we may all doubt what that range of reductions is, but let me say that as long as i am president, i will do everything i can to make sure that the men and women who serve under the american flag will remain the best trained, the best prepared, the best equipped fighting force in the world. and every one of you should make that solemn pledge. we still have responsibilities around the world. we are the world\\'s only superpower. this is still a dangerous and uncertain time, and we owe it to the people in uniform to make sure that we adequately provide for the national defense and for their interests and needs. backed by an effective national defense and a stronger economy, our nation will be prepared to lead a world challenged as it is everywhere by ethnic conflict, by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, by the global democratic revolution, and by challenges to the health of our global environment. i know this economic plan is ambitious, but i honestly believe it is necessary for the continued greatness of the united states. and i think it is paid for fairly, first by cutting government, then by asking the most of those who benefited the most in the past, and by asking more americans to contribute today so that all of us can prosper tomorrow. for the wealthiest, those earning more than $180,000 per year, i ask you all who are listening tonight to support a raise in the top rate for federal income taxes from 31 to 36 percent. we recommend a 10 percent surtax on incomes over $250,000 a year, and we recommend closing some loopholes that let some people get away without paying any tax at all. for businesses with taxable incomes in excess of $10 million, we recommend a raise in the corporate tax rate, also to 36 percent, as well as a cut in the deduction for business entertainment expenses. our plan seeks to attack tax subsidies that actually reward companies more for shutting their operations down here and moving them overseas than for staying here and reinvesting in america. i say that as someone who believes that american companies should be free to invest around the world and as a former governor who actively sought investment of foreign companies in my state. but the tax code should not express a preference to american companies for moving somewhere else, and it does in particular cases today. we will seek to ensure that, through effective tax enforcement, foreign corporations who do make money in america simply pay the same taxes that american companies make on the same income. to middle class americans who have paid a great deal for the last 12 years and from whom i ask a contribution tonight, i will say again as i did on monday night: you\\'re not going alone any more, you\\'re certainly not going first, and you\\'re not going to pay more for less as you have too often in the past. i want to emphasize the facts about this plan: 98.8 percent of america\\'s families will have no increase in their income tax rates, only 1.2 percent at the top. let me be clear: there will also be no new cuts in benefits for medicare. as we move toward the 4th year, with the explosion in health care costs, as i said, projected to account for 50 percent of the growth of the deficit between now and the year 2000, there must be planned cuts in payments to providers, to doctors, to hospitals, to labs, as a way of controlling health care costs. but i see these only as a stopgap until we can reform the entire health care system. if you\\'ll help me do that, we can be fair to the providers and to the consumers of health care. let me repeat this, because i know it matters to a lot of you on both sides of the aisle. this plan does not make a recommendation for new cuts in medicare benefits for any beneficiary. secondly, the only change we are making in social security is one that has already been publicized. the plan does ask older americans with higher incomes, who do not rely solely on social security to get by, to contribute more. this plan will not affect the 80 percent of social security recipients who do not pay taxes on social security now. those who do not pay tax on social security now will not be affected by this plan. our plan does include a broad-based tax on energy, and i want to tell you why i selected this and why i think it\\'s a good idea. i recommend that we adopt a btu tax on the heat content of energy as the best way to provide us with revenue to lower the deficit because it also combats pollution, promotes energy efficiency, promotes the independence, economically, of this country as well as helping to reduce the debt, and because it does not discriminate against any area. unlike a carbon tax, that\\'s not too hard on the coal states; unlike a gas tax, that\\'s not too tough on people who drive a long way to work; unlike an ad valorem tax, it doesn\\'t increase just when the price of an energy source goes up. and it is environmentally responsible. it will help us in the future as well as in the present with the deficit. taken together, these measures will cost an american family with an income of about $40,000 a year less than $17 a month. it will cost american families with incomes under $30,000 nothing because of other programs we propose, principally those raising the earned-income tax credit. because of our publicly stated determination to reduce the deficit, if we do these things, we will see the continuation of what\\'s happened just since the election. just since the election, since the secretary of the treasury, the director of the office of management and budget, and others who have begun to speak out publicly in favor of a tough deficit reduction plan, interest rates have continued to fall long-term. that means that for the middle class who will pay something more each month, if they had any credit needs or demands, their increased energy costs will be more than offset by lower interest costs for mortgages, consumer loans, credit cards. this can be a wise investment for them and their country now. i would also point out what the american people already know, and that is, because we\\'re a big, vast country where we drive long distances, we have maintained far lower burdens on energy than any other advanced country. we will still have far lower burdens on energy than any other advanced country. and these will be spread fairly, with real attempts to make sure that no cost is imposed on families with incomes under $30,000 and that the costs are very modest until you get into the higher income groups where the income taxes trigger in. now, i ask all of you to consider this: whatever you think of the tax program, whatever you think of the spending cuts, consider the cost of not changing. remember the numbers that you all know. if we just keep on doing what we\\'re doing, by the end of the decade we\\'ll have a $650-billion-a-year deficit. if we just keep on doing what we\\'re doing, by the end of the decade 20 percent of our national income will go to health care every year, twice as much as any other country on the face of the globe. if we just keep on doing what we\\'re doing, over 20 cents on the dollar will have to go to service the debt. unless we have the courage now to start building our future and stop borrowing from it, we\\'re condemning ourselves to years of stagnation interrupted by occasional recessions, to slow growth in jobs, to no more growth in income, to more debt, to more disappointment. worse, unless we change, unless we increase investment and reduce the debt to raise productivity so that we can generate both jobs and incomes, we will be condemning our children and our children\\'s children to a lesser life than we enjoyed. once americans looked forward to doubling their living standards every 25 years. at present productivity rates, it will take 100 years to double living standards, until our grandchildren\\'s grandchildren are born. i say that is too long to wait. tonight the american people know we have to change. but they\\'re also likely to ask me tomorrow and all of you for the weeks and months ahead whether we have the fortitude to make the changes happen in the right way. they know that as soon as i leave this chamber and you go home, various interest groups will be out in force lobbying against this or that piece of this plan, and that the forces of conventional wisdom will offer a thousand reasons why we well ought to do this but we just can\\'t do it. our people will be watching and wondering, not to see whether you disagree with me on a particular issue but just to see whether this is going to be business as usual or a real new day, whether we\\'re all going to conduct ourselves as if we know we\\'re working for them. we must scale the walls of the people\\'s scepticisms, not with our words but with our deeds. after so many years of gridlock and indecision, after so many hopeful beginnings and so few promising results, the american people are going to be harsh in their judgments of all of us if we fail to seize this moment. this economic plan can\\'t please everybody. if the package is picked apart, there will be something that will anger each of us, won\\'t please anybody. but if it is taken as a whole, it will help all of us. so i ask you all to begin by resisting the temptation to focus only on a particular spending cut you don\\'t like or some particular investment that wasn\\'t made. and nobody likes the tax increases, but let\\'s just face facts. for 20 years, through administrations of both parties, incomes have stalled and debt has exploded and productivity has not grown as it should. we cannot deny the reality of our condition. we have got to play the hand we were dealt and play it as best we can. my fellow americans, the test of this plan cannot be \"what is in it for me.\" it has got to be \"what is in it for us.\" if we work hard and if we work together, if we rededicate ourselves to creating jobs, to rewarding work, to strengthening our families, to reinventing our government, we can lift our country\\'s fortunes again. tonight i ask everyone in this chamber and every american to look simply into your heart, to spark your own hopes, to fire your own imagination. there is so much good, so much possibility, so much excitement in this country now that if we act boldly and honestly, as leaders should, our legacy will be one of prosperity and progress. this must be america\\'s new direction. let us summon the courage to seize it.thank you. god bless america.'\n",
      " 'thank you very much. mr. speaker, mr. president, members of the 103d congress, my fellow americans: i\\'m not at all sure what speech is in the teleprompter tonight—[laughter]—but i hope we can talk about the state of the union. i ask you to begin by recalling the memory of the giant who presided over this chamber with such force and grace. tip o\\'neill liked to call himself \"a man of the house.\" and he surely was that. but even more, he was a man of the people, a bricklayer\\'s son who helped to build the great american middle class. tip o\\'neill never forgot who he was, where he came from, or who sent him here. tonight he\\'s smiling down on us for the first time from the lord\\'s gallery. but in his honor, may we, too, always remember who we are, where we come from, and who sent us here. if we do that we will return over and over again to the principle that if we simply give ordinary people equal opportunity, quality education, and a fair shot at the american dream, they will do extraordinary things. we gather tonight in a world of changes so profound and rapid that all nations are tested. our american heritage has always been to master such change, to use it to expand opportunity at home and our leadership abroad. but for too long and in too many ways, that heritage was abandoned, and our country drifted. for 30 years, family life in america has been breaking down. for 20 years, the wages of working people have been stagnant or declining. for the 12 years of trickle-down economics, we built a false prosperity on a hollow base as our national debt quadrupled. from 1989 to 1992, we experienced the slowest growth in a half century. for too many families, even when both parents were working, the american dream has been slipping away. in 1992, the american people demanded that we change. a year ago i asked all of you to join me in accepting responsibility for the future of our country. well, we did. we replaced drift and deadlock with renewal and reform. and i want to thank every one of you here who heard the american people, who broke gridlock, who gave them the most successful teamwork between a president and a congress in 30 years. this congress produced a budget that cut the deficit by half a trillion dollars, cut spending, and raised income taxes on only the wealthiest americans. this congress produced tax relief for millions of low-income workers to reward work over welfare. it produced nafta. it produced the brady bill, now the brady law. and thank you, jim brady, for being here, and god bless you, sir. this congress produced tax cuts to reduce the taxes of 9 out of 10 small businesses who use the money to invest more and create more jobs. it produced more research and treatment for aids, more childhood immunizations, more support for women\\'s health research, more affordable college loans for the middle class, a new national service program for those who want to give something back to their country and their communities for higher education, a dramatic increase in high-tech investments to move us from a defense to a domestic high-tech economy. this congress produced a new law, the motor voter bill, to help millions of people register to vote. it produced family and medical leave. all passed. all signed into law with not one single veto. these accomplishments were all commitments i made when i sought this office. and in fairness, they all had to be passed by you in this congress. but i am persuaded that the real credit belongs to the people who sent us here, who pay our salaries, who hold our feet to the fre. but what we do here is really beginning to change lives. let me just give you one example. i will never forget what the family and medical leave law meant to just one father i met early one sunday morning in the white house. it was unusual to see a family there touring early sunday morning, but he had his wife and his three children there, one of them in a wheelchair. i came up, and after we had our picture taken and had a little visit, i was walking off and that man grabbed me by the arm and he said, \"mr. president, let me tell you something. my little girl here is desperately ill. she\\'s probably not going to make it. but because of the family leave law, i was able to take time off to spend with her, the most important time i ever spent in my life, without losing my job and hurting the rest of my family. it means more to me than i will ever be able to say. don\\'t you people up here ever think what you do doesn\\'t make a difference. it does.\" though we are making a difference, our work has just begun. many americans still haven\\'t felt the impact of what we\\'ve done. the recovery still hasn\\'t touched every community or created enough jobs. incomes are still stagnant. there\\'s still too much violence and not enough hope in too many places. abroad, the young democracies we are strongly supporting still face very difficult times and look to us for leadership. and so tonight, let us resolve to continue the journey of renewal, to create more and better jobs, to guarantee health security for all, to reward work over welfare, to promote democracy abroad, and to begin to reclaim our streets from violent crime and drugs and gangs, to renew our own american community. last year we began to put our house in order by tackling the budget deficit that was driving us toward bankruptcy. we cut $255 billion in spending, including entitlements, and over 340 separate budget items. we froze domestic spending and used honest budget numbers. led by the vice president, we launched a campaign to reinvent government. we cut staff, cut perks, even trimmed the fleet of federal limousines. after years of leaders whose rhetoric attacked bureaucracy but whose action expanded it, we will actually reduce it by 252,000 people over the next 5 years. by the time we have finished, the federal bureaucracy will be at its lowest point in 30 years. because the deficit was so large and because they benefited from tax cuts in the 1980\\'s, we did ask the wealthiest americans to pay more to reduce the deficit. so on april the 15th, the american people will discover the truth about what we did last year on taxes. only the top 1—[applause]—yes, listen, the top 1.2 percent of americans, as i said all along, will pay higher income tax rates. let me repeat: only the wealthiest 1.2 percent of americans will face higher income tax rates, and no one else will. and that is the truth. of course, there were, as there always are in politics, naysayers who said this plan wouldn\\'t work. but they were wrong. when i became president, the experts predicted that next year\\'s deficit would be $300 billion. but because we acted, those same people now say the deficit is going to be under $180 billion, 40 percent lower than was previously predicted. our economic program has helped to produce the lowest core inflation rate and the lowest interest rates in 20 years. and because those interest rates are down, business investment and equipment is growing at 7 times the rate of the previous 4 years. auto sales are way up. home sales are at a record high. millions of americans have refinanced their homes, and our economy has produced 1.6 million private sector jobs in 1993, more than were created in the previous 4 years combined. the people who supported this economic plan should be proud of its early results. proud. but everyone in this chamber should know and acknowledge that there is more to do. next month i will send you one of the toughest budgets ever presented to congress. it will cut spending in more than 300 programs,  eliminate 100 domestic programs, and reform the ways in which governments buy goods and services. this year we must again make the hard choices to live within the hard spending ceilings we have set. we must do it. we have proved we can bring the deficit down without choking off recovery, without punishing seniors or the middle class, and without putting our national security at risk. if you will stick with this plan, we will post 3 consecutive years of declining deficits for the first time since harry truman lived in the white house. and once again, the buck stops here. our economic plan also bolsters our strength and our credibility around the world. once we reduced the deficit and put the steel back into our competitive edge, the world echoed with the sound of falling trade barriers. in one year, with nafta, with gatt, with our efforts in asia and the national export strategy, we did more to open world markets to american products than at any time in the last two generations. that means more jobs and rising living standards for the american people, low deficits, low inflation, low interest rates, low trade barriers, and high investments. these are the building blocks of our recovery. but if we want to take full advantage of the opportunities before us in the global economy, you all know we must do more. as we reduce defense spending, i ask congress to invest more in the technologies of tomorrow. defense conversion will keep us strong militarily and create jobs for our people here at home. as we protect our environment, we must invest in the environmental technologies of the future which will create jobs. this year we will fight for a revitalized clean water act and a safe drinking water act and a reformed superfund program. and the vice president is right, we must also work with the private sector to connect every classroom, every clinic, every library, every hospital in america into a national information super highway by the year 2000. think of it, instant access to information will increase productivity, will help to educate our children. it will provide better medical care. it will create jobs. and i call on the congress to pass legislation to establish that information super highway this year. as we expand opportunity and create jobs, no one can be left out. we must continue to enforce fair lending and fair housing and all civil rights laws, because america will never be complete in its renewal until everyone shares in its bounty. but we all know, too, we can do all these things, put our economic house in order, expand world trade, target the jobs of the future, guarantee equal opportunity, but if we\\'re honest, we\\'ll all admit that this strategy still cannot work unless we also give our people the education, training, and skills they need to seize the opportunities of tomorrow. we must set tough, world-class academic and occupational standards for all our children and give our teachers and students the tools they need to meet them. our goals 2000 proposal will empower individual school districts to experiment with ideas like chartering their schools to be run by private corporations or having more public school choice, to do whatever they wish to do as long as we measure every school by one high standard: are our children learning what they need to know to compete and win in the global economy? goals 2000 links world-class standards to grassroots reforms. and i hope congress will pass it without delay. our school to work initiative will for the first time link school to the world of work, providing at least one year of apprenticeship beyond high school. after all, most of the people we\\'re counting on to build our economic future won\\'t graduate from college. it\\'s time to stop ignoring them and start empowering them. we must literally transform our outdated unemployment system into a new reemployment system. the old unemployment system just sort of kept you going while you waited for your old job to come back. we\\'ve got to have a new system to move people into new and better jobs, because most of those old jobs just don\\'t come back. and we know that the only way to have real job security in the future, to get a good job with a growing income, is to have real skills and the ability to learn new ones. so we\\'ve got to streamline today\\'s patchwork of training programs and make them a source of new skills for our people who lose their jobs. reemployment, not unemployment, must become the centerpiece of our economic renewal. i urge you to pass it in this session of congress. and just as we must transform our unemployment system, so must we also revolutionize our welfare system. it doesn\\'t work. it defies our values as a nation. if we value work, we can\\'t justify a system that makes welfare more attractive than work if people are worried about losing their health care. if we value responsibility, we can\\'t ignore the $34 billion in child support absent parents ought to be paying to millions of parents who are taking care of their children. if we value strong families, we can\\'t perpetuate a system that actually penalizes those who stay together. can you believe that a child who has a child gets more money from the government for leaving home than for staying home with a parent or a grandparent? that\\'s not just bad policy, it\\'s wrong. and we ought to change it. i worked on this problem for years before i became president, with other governors and with members of congress of both parties and with the previous administration of another party. i worked on it with people who were on welfare, lots of them. and i want to say something to everybody here who cares about this issue. the people who most want to change this system are the people who are dependent on it. they want to get off welfare. they want to go back to work. they want to do right by their kids. i once had a hearing when i was a governor, and i brought in people on welfare from all over america who had found their way to work. the woman from my state who testified was asked this question: what\\'s the best thing about being off welfare and in a job? and without blinking an eye, she looked at 40 governors, and she said, \"when my boy goes to school and they say what does you mother do for a living, he can give an answer.\" these people want a better system, and we ought to give it to them. last year we began this. we gave the states more power to innovate because we know that a lot of great ideas come from outside washington, and many states are already using it. then this congress took a dramatic step. instead of taxing people with modest incomes into poverty, we helped them to work their way out of poverty by dramatically increasing the earned-income tax credit. it will lift 15 million working families out of poverty, rewarding work over welfare, making it possible for people to be successful workers and successful parents. now that\\'s real welfare reform. but there is more to be done. this spring i will send you a comprehensive welfare reform bill that  builds on the family support act of 1988 and restores the basic values of work and responsibility. we\\'ll say to teenagers, \"if you have a child out of wedlock, we will no longer give you a check to set up a separate household. we want families to stay together;\" say to absent parents who aren\\'t paying their child support, \"if you\\'re not providing for your children, we\\'ll garnish your wages, suspend your license, track you across state lines, and if necessary, make some of you work off what you owe.\" people who bring children into this world cannot and must not walk away from them. but to all those who depend on welfare, we should offer ultimately a simple compact. we\\'ll provide the support, the job training, the child care you need for up to 2 years. but after that, anyone who can work, must, in the private sector wherever possible, in community service, if necessary. that\\'s the only way we\\'ll ever make welfare what it ought to be, a second chance, not a way of life. i know it will be difficult to tackle welfare reform in 1994 at the same time we tackle health care. but let me point out, i think it is inevitable and imperative. it is estimated that one million people are on welfare today because it\\'s the only way they can get health care coverage for their children. those who choose to leave welfare for jobs without health benefits, and many entry-level jobs don\\'t have health benefits, find themselves in the incredible position of paying taxes that help to pay for health care coverage for those who made the other choice to stay on welfare. no wonder  people leave work and go back to welfare to get health care coverage. we\\'ve got to solve the health care problem to have real welfare reform. so this year, we will make history by reforming the health care system. and i would say to you, all of you, my fellow public servants, this is another issue where the people are way ahead of the politicians. that may not be popular with either party, but it happens to be the truth. you know, the first lady has received now almost a million letters from people all across america and from all walks of life. i\\'d like to share just one of them with you. richard anderson of reno, nevada, lost his job and with it, his health insurance. two weeks later his wife, judy, suffered a cerebral aneurysm. he rushed her to the hospital, where she stayed in intensive care for 21 days. the andersons\\' bills were over $120,000. although judy recovered and richard went back to work at $8 an hour, the bills were too much for them, and they were literally forced into bankruptcy. \"mrs. clinton,\" he wrote to hillary, \"no one in the united states of america should have to lose everything they\\'ve worked for all their lives because they were unfortunate enough to become ill.\" it was to help the richard and judy andersons of america that the first lady and so many others have worked so hard and so long on this health care reform issue. we owe them our thanks and our action. i know there are people here who say there\\'s no health care crisis. tell it to richard and judy anderson. tell it to the 58 million americans who have no coverage at all for some time each year. tell it to the 81 million americans with those preexisting conditions. those folks are paying more, or they can\\'t get insurance at all. or they can\\'t ever change their jobs because they or someone in their family has one of those preexisting conditions. tell it to the small businesses burdened by the skyrocketing cost of insurance. most small businesses cover their employees, and they pay on average 35 percent more in premiums than big businesses or government. or tell it to the 76 percent of insured americans, three out of four whose policies have lifetime limits. and that means they can find themselves without any coverage at all just when they need it the most. so if any of you believe there\\'s no crisis, you tell it to those people, because i can\\'t. there are some people who literally do not understand the impact of this problem on people\\'s lives. and all you have to do is go out and listen to them. just go talk to them anywhere in any congressional district in this country. they\\'re republicans and democrats and independents; it doesn\\'t have a lick to do with party. they think we don\\'t get it. and it\\'s time we show them that we do get it. from the day we began, our health care initiative has been designed to strengthen what is good about our health care system: the world\\'s best health care professionals, cutting-edge research and wonderful research institutions, medicare for older americans. none of this, none of it should be put at risk. but we\\'re paying more and more money for less and less care. every year fewer and fewer americans even get to choose their doctors. every year doctors and nurses spend more time on paperwork and less time with patients because of the absolute bureaucratic nightmare the present system has become. this system is riddled with inefficiency, with abuse, with fraud, and everybody knows it. in today\\'s health care system, insurance companies call the shots. they pick whom they cover and how they cover them. they can cut off your benefits when you need your coverage the most. they are in charge. what does it mean? it means every night millions of well-insured americans go to bed just an illness, an accident, or a pink slip away from having no coverage or financial ruin. it means every morning millions of americans go to work without any health insurance at all, something the workers in no other advanced country in the world do. it means that every year, more and more hard-working people are told to pick a new doctor because their boss has had to pick a new plan. and countless others turn down better jobs because they know if they take the better job, they will lose their health insurance. if we just let the health care system continue to drift, our country will have people with less care, fewer choices, and higher bills. now, our approach protects the quality of care and people\\'s choices. it builds on what works today in the private sector, to expand employer-based coverage, to guarantee private insurance for every american. and i might say, employer-based private insurance for every american was proposed 20 years ago by president richard nixon to the united states congress. it was a good idea then, and it\\'s a better idea today. why do we want guaranteed private insurance? because right now 9 out of 10 people who have insurance get it through their employers. and that should continue. and if your employer is providing good benefits at reasonable prices, that should continue, too. that ought to make the congress and the president feel better. our goal is health insurance everybody can depend on: comprehensive benefits that cover preventive care and prescription drugs; health premiums that don\\'t just explode when you get sick or you get older; the power, no matter how small your business is, to choose dependable insurance at the same competitive rates governments and big business get today; one simple form for people who are sick; and most of all, the freedom to choose a plan and the right to choose your own doctor. our approach protects older americans. every plan before the congress proposes to slow the growth of medicare. the difference is this: we believe those savings should be used to improve health care for senior citizens. medicare must be protected, and it should cover prescription drugs, and we should take the first steps in covering long-term care. to those who would cut medicare without protecting seniors, i say the solution to today\\'s squeeze on middle-class working people\\'s health care is not to put the squeeze on middle-class retired people\\'s health care. we can do better than that. when it\\'s all said and done, it\\'s pretty simple to me. insurance ought to mean what it used to mean: you pay a fair price for security, and when you get sick, health care\\'s always there, no matter what. along with the guarantee of health security, we all have to admit, too, there must be more responsibility on the part of all of us in how we use this system. people have to take their kids to get immunized. we should all take advantage of preventive care. we must all work together to stop the violence that explodes our emergency rooms. we have to practice better health habits, and we can\\'t abuse the system. and those who don\\'t have insurance under our approach will get coverage, but they\\'ll have to pay something for it, too. the minority of businesses that provide no insurance at all and in so doing shift the cost of the care of their employees to others, should contribute something. people who smoke should pay more for a pack of cigarettes. everybody can contribute something if we want to solve the health care crisis. there can\\'t be any more something for nothing. it will not be easy but it can be done. now, in the coming months i hope very much to work with both democrats and republicans to reform a health care system by using the market to bring down costs and to achieve lasting health security. but if you look at history we see that for 60 years this country has tried to reform health care. president roosevelt tried. president truman tried. president nixon tried. president carter tried. every time the special interests were powerful enough to defeat them. but not this time. i know that facing up to these interests will require courage. it will raise critical questions about the way we finance our campaigns and how lobbyists yield their influence. the work of change, frankly, will never get any easier until we limit the influence of well-financed interests who profit from this current system. so i also must now call on you to finish the job both houses began last year by passing tough and meaningful campaign finance reform and lobby reform legislation this year. you know, my fellow americans, this is really a test for all of us. the american people provide those of us in government service with terrific health care benefits at reasonable costs. we have health care that\\'s always there. i think we need to give every hard-working, tax-paying american the same health care security they have already given to us. i want to make this very clear. i am open, as i have said repeatedly, to the best ideas of concerned members of both parties. i have no special brief for any specific approach, even in our own bill, except this: if you send me legislation that does not guarantee every american private health insurance that can never be taken away, you will force me to take this pen, veto the legislation, and we\\'ll come right back here and start all over again. but i don\\'t think that\\'s going to happen. i think we\\'re ready to act now. i believe that you\\'re ready to act now. and if you\\'re ready to guarantee every american the same health care that you have, health care that can never be taken away, now, not next year or the year after, now is the time to stand with the people who sent us here. now. as we take these steps together to renew our strength at home, we cannot turn away from our obligation to renew our leadership abroad. this is a promising moment. because of the agreements we have reached this year, last year, russia\\'s strategic nuclear missiles soon will no longer be pointed at the united states, nor will we point ours at them. instead of building weapons in space, russian scientists will help us to build the international space station. of course, there are still dangers in the world: rampant arms proliferation, bitter regional conflicts, ethnic and nationalist tensions in many new democracies, severe environmental degradation the world over, and fanatics who seek to cripple the world\\'s cities with terror. as the world\\'s greatest power, we must, therefore, maintain our defenses and our responsibilities. this year, we secured indictments against terrorists and sanctions against those who harbor them. we worked to promote environmentally sustainable economic growth. we achieved agreements with ukraine, with belarus, with kazakhstan to eliminate completely their nuclear arsenal. we are working to achieve a korean peninsula free of nuclear weapons. we will seek early ratification of a treaty to ban chemical weapons worldwide. and earlier today, we joined with over 30 nations to begin negotiations on a comprehensive ban to stop all nuclear testing. but nothing, nothing is more important to our security than our nation\\'s armed forces. we honor their contributions, including those who are carrying out the longest humanitarian air lift in history in bosnia, those who will complete their mission in somalia this year and their brave comrades who gave their lives there. our forces are the finest military our nation has ever had. and i have pledged that as long as i am president, they will remain the best equipped, the best trained, and the best prepared fighting force on the face of the earth. last year i proposed a defense plan that maintains our post-cold-war security at a lower cost. this year many people urged me to cut our defense spending further to pay for other government programs. i said, no. the budget i send to congress draws the line against further defense cuts. it protects the readiness and quality of our forces. ultimately, the best strategy is to do that. we must not cut defense further. i hope the congress, without regard to party, will support that position. ultimately, the best strategy to ensure our security and to build a durable peace is to support the advance of democracy elsewhere. democracies don\\'t attack each other, they make better trading partners and partners in diplomacy. that is why we have supported, you and i, the democratic reformers in russia and in the other states of the former soviet bloc. i applaud the bipartisan support this congress provided last year for our initiatives to help russia, ukraine, and the other states through their epic transformations. our support of reform must combine patience for the enormity of the task and vigilance for our fundamental interest and values. we will continue to urge russia and the other states to press ahead with economic reforms. and we will seek to cooperate with russia to solve regional problems, while insisting that if russian troops operate in neighboring states, they do so only when those states agree to their presence and in strict accord with international standards. but we must also remember as these nations chart their own futures—and they must chart their own futures—how much more secure and more prosperous our own people will be if democratic and market reforms succeed all across the former communist bloc. our policy has been to support that move, and that has been the policy of the congress. we should continue it. that is why i went to europe earlier this month, to work with our european partners, to help to integrate all the former communist countries into a europe that has a possibility of becoming unified for the first time in its entire history, its entire history, based on the simple commitments of all nations in europe to democracy, to free markets, and to respect for existing borders. with our allies we have created a partnership for peace that invites states from the former soviet bloc and other non-nato members to work with nato in military cooperation. when i met with central europe\\'s leaders, including lech walesa and vбclav havel, men who put their lives on the line for freedom, i told them that the security of their region is important to our country\\'s security. this year we must also do more to support democratic renewal and human rights and sustainable development all around the world. we will ask congress to ratify the new gatt accord. we will continue standing by south africa as it works its way through its bold and hopeful and difficult transition to democracy. we will convene a summit of the western hemisphere\\'s democratic leaders from canada to the tip of south america. and we will continue to press for the restoration of true democracy in haiti. and as we build a more constructive relationship with china, we must continue to insist on clear signs of improvement in that nation\\'s human rights record. we will also work for new progress toward the middle east peace. last year the world watched yitzhak rabin and yasser arafat at the white house when they had their historic handshake of reconciliation. but there is a long, hard road ahead. and on that road i am determined that i and our administration will do all we can to achieve a comprehensive and lasting peace for all the peoples of the region. now, there are some in our country who argue that with the cold war, america should turn its back on the rest of the world. many around the world were afraid we would do just that. but i took this office on a pledge that had no partisan tinge, to keep our nation secure by remaining engaged in the rest of the world. and this year, because of our work together, enacting nafta, keeping our military strong and prepared, supporting democracy abroad, we have reaffirmed america\\'s leadership, america\\'s engagement. and as a result, the american people are more secure than they were before. but while americans are more secure from threats abroad, i think we all know that in many ways we are less secure from threats here at home. every day the national peace is shattered by crime. in petaluma, california, an innocent slumber party gives way to agonizing tragedy for the family of polly klaas.  an ordinary train  ride on long island ends in a hail of 9-millimeter rounds. a tourist in florida is nearly burned alive by bigots simply because he is black. right here in our nation\\'s capital, a brave young man named jason white, a policeman, the son and grandson of policemen, is ruthlessly gunned down. violent crime and the fear it provokes are crippling our society, limiting personal freedom, and fraying the ties that bind us. the crime bill before congress gives you a chance to do something about it, a chance to be tough and smart. what does that mean? let me begin by saying i care a lot about this issue. many years ago, when i started out in public life, i was the attorney general of my state. i served as  a governor for a dozen years. i know what it\\'s like to sign laws increasing penalties, to build more prison cells, to carry out the death penalty. i understand this issue. and it is not a simple thing. first, we must recognize that most violent crimes are committed by a small percentage of criminals who too often break the laws even when they are on parole. now those who commit crimes should be punished. and those who commit repeated, violent crimes should be told, \"when you commit a third violent crime, you will be put away, and put away for good. three strikes, and you are out.\" second, we must take serious steps to reduce violence and prevent crime, beginning with more police officers and more community policing. we know right now that police who work the streets, know the folks, have the respect of the neighborhood kids, focus on high crime areas, we know that they are more likely to prevent crime as well as catch criminals. look at the experience of houston, where the crime rate dropped 17 percent in one year when that approach was taken. here tonight is one of those community policemen, a brave, young detective, kevin jett, whose beat is eight square blocks in one of the toughest neighborhoods in new york. every day he restores some sanity and safety and a sense of values and connections to the people whose lives he protects. i\\'d like to ask him to stand  up and be recognized tonight. thank you, sir. [applause] you will be given a chance to give the children of this country, the law-abiding working people of this country—and don\\'t forget, in the toughest neighborhoods in this country, in the highest crime neighborhoods in this country, the vast majority of people get up every day and obey the law, pay their taxes, do their best to raise their kids. they deserve people like kevin jett. and you\\'re going to be given a chance to give the american people another 100,000 of them, well trained. and i urge you to do it. you have before you crime legislation which also establishes a police corps to encourage young people to get an education and pay it off by serving as police officers; which encourages retiring military personnel to move into police forces, an inordinate resource for our country; one which has a safe schools provision which will give our young people the chance to walk to school in safety and to be in school in safety instead of dodging bullets. these are important things. the third thing we have to do is to build on the brady bill, the brady law, to take further steps to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. i want to say something about this issue. hunters must always be free to hunt. law-abiding adults should always be free to own guns and protect their homes. i respect that part of our culture; i grew up in it. but i want to ask the sportsmen and others who lawfully own guns to join us in this campaign to reduce gun violence. i say to you, i know you didn\\'t create this problem, but we need your help to solve it. there is no sporting purpose on earth that should stop the united states congress from banishing assault weapons that out-gun police and cut down children. fourth, we must remember that drugs are a factor in an enormous percentage of crimes. recent studies indicate, sadly, that drug use is on the rise again among our young people. the crime bill contains—all the crime bills contain—more money for drug treatment for criminal addicts and boot camps for youthful offenders that include incentives to get off drugs and to stay off drugs. our administration\\'s budget, with all its cuts, contains a large increase in funding for drug treatment and drug education. you must pass them both. we need them desperately. my fellow americans, the problem of violence is an american problem. it has no partisan or philosophical element. therefore, i urge you to find ways as quickly as possible to set aside partisan differences and pass a strong, smart, tough crime bill. but further, i urge you to consider this: as you demand tougher penalties for those who choose violence, let us also remember how we came to this sad point. in our toughest neighborhoods, on our meanest streets, in our poorest rural areas, we have seen a stunning and simultaneous breakdown of community, family, and work, the heart and soul of civilized society. this has created a vast vacuum which has been filled by violence and drugs and gangs. so i ask you to remember  that even as we say \"no\" to crime, we must give people, especially our young people, something to say \"yes\" to. many of our initiatives, from job training to welfare reform to health care to national service, will help to rebuild distressed communities, to strengthen families, to provide work. but more needs to be done. that\\'s what our community empowerment agenda is all about, challenging businesses to provide more investment through empowerment zones, ensuring banks will make loans in the same communities their deposits come from, passing legislation to unleash the power of capital through community development banks to create jobs, opportunity, and hope where they\\'re needed most. i think you know that to really solve this problem, we\\'ll all have to put our heads together, leave our ideological armor aside, and find some new ideas to do even more. and let\\'s be honest, we all know something else too: our problems go way beyond the reach of government. they\\'re rooted in the loss of values, in the disappearance of work, and the breakdown of our families and our communities. my fellow americans, we can cut the deficit, create jobs, promote democracy around the world, pass welfare reform and health care, pass the toughest crime bill in history, but still leave too many of our people behind. the american people have got to want to change from within if we\\'re going to bring back work and family and community. we cannot renew our country when within a decade more than half of the children will be born into families where there has been no marriage. we cannot renew this country when 13-year-old boys get semi-automatic weapons to shoot 9-year-olds for kicks. we can\\'t renew our country when children are having children, and the fathers walk away as if the kids don\\'t amount to anything. we can\\'t renew the country when our businesses eagerly look for new investments and new customers abroad but ignore those people right here at home who would give anything to have their jobs and would gladly buy their products if they had the money to do it. we can\\'t renew our country unless more of usi mean, all of us—are willing to join the churches and the other good citizens, people like all the ministers i\\'ve worked with over the years or the priests and the nuns i met at our lady of help in east los angeles or my good friend tony campollo in philadelphia, unless we\\'re willing to work with people like that, people who are saving kids, adopting schools, making streets safer. all of us can do that. we can\\'t renew our country until we realize that governments don\\'t raise children, parents do. parents who know their children\\'s teachers and turn off the television and help with the homework and teach their kids right from wrong, those kinds of parents can make all the difference. i know, i had one. i\\'m telling you, we have got to stop pointing our fingers at these kids who have no future and reach our hands out to them. our country needs it, we need it, and they deserve it. so i say to you tonight, let\\'s give our children a future. let us take away their guns and give them books. let us overcome their despair and replace it with hope. let us, by our example, teach them to obey the law, respect our neighbors, and cherish our values. let us weave these sturdy threads into a new american community that can once more stand strong against the forces of despair and evil because everybody has a chance to walk into a better tomorrow. oh, there will be naysayers who fear that we won\\'t be equal to the challenges of this time. but they misread our history, our heritage. even today\\'s headlines, all those things tell us we can and we will overcome any challenge. when the earth shook and fires raged in california, when i saw the mississippi deluge the farmlands of the midwest in a 500-year flood, when the century\\'s bitterest cold swept from north dakota to newport news, it seemed as though the world itself was coming apart at the seams. but the american people, they just came together. they rose to the occasion, neighbor helping neighbor, strangers risking life and limb to save total strangers, showing the better angels of our nature. let us not reserve the better angels only for natural disasters, leaving our deepest and most profound problems to petty political fighting. let us instead be true to our spirit, facing facts, coming together, bringing hope, and moving forward. tonight, my fellow americans, we are summoned to answer a question as old as the republic itself: what is the state of our union? it is growing stronger, but it must be stronger still. with your help, and god\\'s help, it will be. thank you, and god bless america.'\n",
      " 'as a new congress gathers, all of us in the elected branches of government share a great privilege: we\\'ve been placed in office by the votes of the people we serve. and tonight that is a privilege we share with newly-elected leaders of afghanistan, the palestinian territories, ukraine, and a free and sovereign iraq. two weeks ago, i stood on the steps of this capitol and renewed the commitment of our nation to the guiding ideal of liberty for all. this evening i will set forth policies to advance that ideal at home and around the world.tonight, with a healthy, growing economy, with more americans going back to work, with our nation an active force for good in the world — the state of our union is confident and strong. our generation has been blessed — by the expansion of opportunity, by advances in medicine, by the security purchased by our parents\\' sacrifice. now, as we see a little gray in the mirror — or a lot of gray — and we watch our children moving into adulthood, we ask the question: what will be the state of their union? members of congress, the choices we make together will answer that question. over the next several months, on issue after issue, let us do what americans have always done, and build a better world for our children and our grandchildren. first, we must be good stewards of this economy, and renew the great institutions on which millions of our fellow citizens rely. america\\'s economy is the fastest growing of any major industrialized nation. in the past four years, we provided tax relief to every person who pays income taxes, overcome a recession, opened up new markets abroad, prosecuted corporate criminals, raised homeownership to its highest level in history, and in the last year alone, the united states has added 2.3 million new jobs.  when action was needed, the congress delivered — and the nation is grateful.now we must add to these achievements. by making our economy more flexible, more innovative, and more competitive, we will keep america the economic leader of the world. america\\'s prosperity requires restraining the spending appetite of the federal government. i welcome the bipartisan enthusiasm for spending discipline. i will send you a budget that holds the growth of discretionary spending below inflation, makes tax relief permanent, and stays on track to cut the deficit in half by 2009.  my budget substantially reduces or eliminates more than 150 government programs that are not getting results, or duplicate current efforts, or do not fulfill essential priorities. the principle here is clear: taxpayer dollars must be spent wisely, or not at all. to make our economy stronger and more dynamic, we must prepare a rising generation to fill the jobs of the 21st century. under the no child left behind act, standards are higher, test scores are on the rise, and we\\'re closing the achievement gap for minority students. now we must demand better results from our high schools, so every high school diploma is a ticket to success. we will help an additional 200,000 workers to get training for a better career, by reforming our job training system and strengthening america\\'s community colleges. and we\\'ll make it easier for americans to afford a college education, by increasing the size of pell grants. to make our economy stronger and more competitive, america must reward, not punish, the efforts and dreams of entrepreneurs. small business is the path of advancement, especially for women and minorities, so we must free small businesses from needless regulation and protect honest job-creators from junk lawsuits.  justice is distorted, and our economy is held back by irresponsible class-actions and frivolous asbestos claims — and i urge congress to pass legal reforms this year. to make our economy stronger and more productive, we must make health care more affordable, and give families greater access to good coverage — and more control over their health decisions.  i ask congress to move forward on a comprehensive health care agenda with tax credits to help low-income workers buy insurance, a community health center in every poor county, improved information technology to prevent medical error and needless costs, association health plans for small businesses and their employees —  — expanded health savings accounts — and medical liability reform that will reduce health care costs and make sure patients have the doctors and care they need. to keep our economy growing, we also need reliable supplies of affordable, environmentally responsible energy.  nearly four years ago, i submitted a comprehensive energy strategy that encourages conservation, alternative sources, a modernized electricity grid, and more production here at home — including safe, clean nuclear energy.  my clear skies legislation will cut power plant pollution and improve the health of our citizens.  and my budget provides strong funding for leading-edge technology — from hydrogen-fueled cars, to clean coal, to renewable sources such as ethanol.  four years of debate is enough: i urge congress to pass legislation that makes america more secure and less dependent on foreign energy. all these proposals are essential to expand this economy and add new jobs — but they are just the beginning of our duty. to build the prosperity of future generations, we must update institutions that were created to meet the needs of an earlier time. year after year, americans are burdened by an archaic, incoherent federal tax code. i\\'ve appointed a bipartisan panel to examine the tax code from top to bottom. and when their recommendations are delivered, you and i will work together to give this nation a tax code that is pro-growth, easy to understand, and fair to all. america\\'s immigration system is also outdated — unsuited to the needs of our economy and to the values of our country. we should not be content with laws that punish hardworking people who want only to provide for their families, and deny businesses willing workers, and invite chaos at our border. it is time for an immigration policy that permits temporary guest workers to fill jobs americans will not take, that rejects amnesty, that tells us who is entering and leaving our country, and that closes the border to drug dealers and terrorists. one of america\\'s most important institutions — a symbol of the trust between generations — is also in need of wise and effective reform. social security was a great moral success of the 20th century, and we must honor its great purposes in this new century.  the system, however, on its current path, is headed toward bankruptcy. and so we must join together to strengthen and save social security. today, more than 45 million americans receive social security benefits, and millions more are nearing retirement — and for them the system is sound and fiscally strong. i have a message for every american who is 55 or older: do not let anyone mislead you; for you, the social security system will not change in any way.  for younger workers, the social security system has serious problems that will grow worse with time. social security was created decades ago, for a very different era. in those days, people did not live as long. benefits were much lower than they are today. and a half-century ago, about sixteen workers paid into the system for each person drawing benefits.our society has changed in ways the founders of social security could not have foreseen. in today\\'s world, people are living longer and, therefore, drawing benefits longer. and those benefits are scheduled to rise dramatically over the next few decades. and instead of sixteen workers paying in for every beneficiary, right now it\\'s only about three workers. and over the next few decades that number will fall to just two workers per beneficiary. with each passing year, fewer workers are paying ever-higher benefits to an ever-larger number of retirees.so here is the result: thirteen years from now, in 2018, social security will be paying out more than it takes in. and every year afterward will bring a new shortfall, bigger than the year before. for example, in the year 2027, the government will somehow have to come up with an extra $200 billion to keep the system afloat — and by 2033, the annual shortfall would be more than $300 billion. by the year 2042, the entire system would be exhausted and bankrupt. if steps are not taken to avert that outcome, the only solutions would be dramatically higher taxes, massive new borrowing, or sudden and severe cuts in social security benefits or other government programs.i recognize that 2018 and 2042 may seem a long way off. but those dates are not so distant, as any parent will tell you. if you have a five-year-old, you\\'re already concerned about how you\\'ll pay for college tuition 13 years down the road. if you\\'ve got children in their 20s, as some of us do, the idea of social security collapsing before they retire does not seem like a small matter. and it should not be a small matter to the united states congress.  you and i share a responsibility. we must pass reforms that solve the financial problems of social security once and for all.fixing social security permanently will require an open, candid review of the options. some have suggested limiting benefits for wealthy retirees. former congressman tim penny has raised the possibility of indexing benefits to prices rather than wages. during the 1990s, my predecessor, president clinton, spoke of increasing the retirement age. former senator john breaux suggested discouraging early collection of social security benefits. the late senator daniel patrick moynihan recommended changing the way benefits are calculated. all these ideas are on the table.i know that none of these reforms would be easy. but we have to move ahead with courage and honesty, because our children\\'s retirement security is more important than partisan politics.  i will work with members of congress to find the most effective combination of reforms. i will listen to anyone who has a good idea to offer.  we must, however, be guided by some basic principles. we must make social security permanently sound, not leave that task for another day. we must not jeopardize our economic strength by increasing payroll taxes. we must ensure that lower-income americans get the help they need to have dignity and peace of mind in their retirement. we must guarantee there is no change for those now retired or nearing retirement. and we must take care that any changes in the system are gradual, so younger workers have years to prepare and plan for their future.as we fix social security, we also have the responsibility to make the system a better deal for younger workers. and the best way to reach that goal is through voluntary personal retirement accounts.  here is how the idea works. right now, a set portion of the money you earn is taken out of your paycheck to pay for the social security benefits of today\\'s retirees. if you\\'re a younger worker, i believe you should be able to set aside part of that money in your own retirement account, so you can build a nest egg for your own future.here\\'s why the personal accounts are a better deal. your money will grow, over time, at a greater rate than anything the current system can deliver — and your account will provide money for retirement over and above the check you will receive from social security. in addition, you\\'ll be able to pass along the money that accumulates in your personal account, if you wish, to your children and — or grandchildren. and best of all, the money in the account is yours, and the government can never take it away. the goal here is greater security in retirement, so we will set careful guidelines for personal accounts. we\\'ll make sure the money can only go into a conservative mix of bonds and stock funds. we\\'ll make sure that your earnings are not eaten up by hidden wall street fees. we\\'ll make sure there are good options to protect your investments from sudden market swings on the eve of your retirement. we\\'ll make sure a personal account cannot be emptied out all at once, but rather paid out over time, as an addition to traditional social security benefits. and we\\'ll make sure this plan is fiscally responsible, by starting personal retirement accounts gradually, and raising the yearly limits on contributions over time, eventually permitting all workers to set aside four percentage points of their payroll taxes in their accounts.personal retirement accounts should be familiar to federal employees, because you already have something similar, called the thrift savings plan, which lets workers deposit a portion of their paychecks into any of five different broadly-based investment funds. it\\'s time to extend the same security, and choice, and ownership to young americans. our second great responsibility to our children and grandchildren is to honor and to pass along the values that sustain a free society. so many of my generation, after a long journey, have come home to family and faith, and are determined to bring up responsible, moral children. government is not the source of these values, but government should never undermine them.because marriage is a sacred institution and the foundation of society, it should not be re-defined by activist judges. for the good of families, children, and society, i support a constitutional amendment to protect the institution of marriage. because a society is measured by how it treats the weak and vulnerable, we must strive to build a culture of life. medical research can help us reach that goal, by developing treatments and cures that save lives and help people overcome disabilities — and i thank the congress for doubling the funding of the national institutes of health.  to build a culture of life, we must also ensure that scientific advances always serve human dignity, not take advantage of some lives for the benefit of others. we should all be able to agree —  — we should all be able to agree on some clear standards. i will work with congress to ensure that human embryos are not created for experimentation or grown for body parts, and that human life is never bought and sold as a commodity.  america will continue to lead the world in medical research that is ambitious, aggressive, and always ethical.because courts must always deliver impartial justice, judges have a duty to faithfully interpret the law, not legislate from the bench.  as president, i have a constitutional responsibility to nominate men and women who understand the role of courts in our democracy, and are well-qualified to serve on the bench — and i have done so.  the constitution also gives the senate a responsibility: every judicial nominee deserves an up or down vote. because one of the deepest values of our country is compassion, we must never turn away from any citizen who feels isolated from the opportunities of america. our government will continue to support faith-based and community groups that bring hope to harsh places. now we need to focus on giving young people, especially young men in our cities, better options than apathy, or gangs, or jail. tonight i propose a three-year initiative to help organizations keep young people out of gangs, and show young men an ideal of manhood that respects women and rejects violence.  taking on gang life will be one part of a broader outreach to at-risk youth, which involves parents and pastors, coaches and community leaders, in programs ranging from literacy to sports. and i am proud that the leader of this nationwide effort will be our first lady, laura bush. because hiv/aids brings suffering and fear into so many lives, i ask you to reauthorize the ryan white act to encourage prevention, and provide care and treatment to the victims of that disease.  and as we update this important law, we must focus our efforts on fellow citizens with the highest rates of new cases, african american men and women. because one of the main sources of our national unity is our belief in equal justice, we need to make sure americans of all races and backgrounds have confidence in the system that provides justice. in america we must make doubly sure no person is held to account for a crime he or she did not commit — so we are dramatically expanding the use of dna evidence to prevent wrongful conviction.  soon i will send to congress a proposal to fund special training for defense counsel in capital cases, because people on trial for their lives must have competent lawyers by their side. our third responsibility to future generations is to leave them an america that is safe from danger, and protected by peace. we will pass along to our children all the freedoms we enjoy — and chief among them is freedom from fear.in the three and a half years since september the 11th, 2001, we have taken unprecedented actions to protect americans. we\\'ve created a new department of government to defend our homeland, focused the fbi on preventing terrorism, begun to reform our intelligence agencies, broken up terror cells across the country, expanded research on defenses against biological and chemical attack, improved border security, and trained more than a half-million first responders. police and firefighters, air marshals, researchers, and so many others are working every day to make our homeland safer, and we thank them all. our nation, working with allies and friends, has also confronted the enemy abroad, with measures that are determined, successful, and continuing. the al qaeda terror network that attacked our country still has leaders — but many of its top commanders have been removed. there are still governments that sponsor and harbor terrorists — but their number has declined. there are still regimes seeking weapons of mass destruction — but no longer without attention and without consequence. our country is still the target of terrorists who want to kill many, and intimidate us all — and we will stay on the offensive against them, until the fight is won. pursuing our enemies is a vital commitment of the war on terror — and i thank the congress for providing our servicemen and women with the resources they have needed. during this time of war, we must continue to support our military and give them the tools for victory. other nations around the globe have stood with us. in afghanistan, an international force is helping provide security. in iraq, 28 countries have troops on the ground, the united nations and the european union provided technical assistance for the elections, and nato is leading a mission to help train iraqi officers. we\\'re cooperating with 60 governments in the proliferation security initiative, to detect and stop the transit of dangerous materials. we\\'re working closely with the governments in asia to convince north korea to abandon its nuclear ambitions. pakistan, saudi arabia, and nine other countries have captured or detained al qaeda terrorists. in the next four years, my administration will continue to build the coalitions that will defeat the dangers of our time. in the long-term, the peace we seek will only be achieved by eliminating the conditions that feed radicalism and ideologies of murder. if whole regions of the world remain in despair and grow in hatred, they will be the recruiting grounds for terror, and that terror will stalk america and other free nations for decades. the only force powerful enough to stop the rise of tyranny and terror, and replace hatred with hope, is the force of human freedom.  our enemies know this, and that is why the terrorist zarqawi recently declared war on what he called the \"evil principle\" of democracy. and we\\'ve declared our own intention: america will stand with the allies of freedom to support democratic movements in the middle east and beyond, with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world. the united states has no right, no desire, and no intention to impose our form of government on anyone else. that is one of the main differences between us and our enemies. they seek to impose and expand an empire of oppression, in which a tiny group of brutal, self-appointed rulers control every aspect of every life. our aim is to build and preserve a community of free and independent nations, with governments that answer to their citizens, and reflect their own cultures. and because democracies respect their own people and their neighbors, the advance of freedom will lead to peace. that advance has great momentum in our time — shown by women voting in afghanistan, and palestinians choosing a new direction, and the people of ukraine asserting their democratic rights and electing a president. we are witnessing landmark events in the history of liberty. and in the coming years, we will add to that story. the beginnings of reform and democracy in the palestinian territories are now showing the power of freedom to break old patterns of violence and failure. tomorrow morning, secretary of state rice departs on a trip that will take her to israel and the west bank for meetings with prime minister sharon and president abbas. she will discuss with them how we and our friends can help the palestinian people end terror and build the institutions of a peaceful, independent, democratic state. to promote this democracy, i will ask congress for $350 million to support palestinian political, economic, and security reforms. the goal of two democratic states, israel and palestine, living side by side in peace, is within reach — and america will help them achieve that goal. to promote peace and stability in the broader middle east, the united states will work with our friends in the region to fight the common threat of terror, while we encourage a higher standard of freedom. hopeful reform is already taking hold in an arc from morocco to jordan to bahrain. the government of saudi arabia can demonstrate its leadership in the region by expanding the role of its people in determining their future. and the great and proud nation of egypt, which showed the way toward peace in the middle east, can now show the way toward democracy in the middle east. to promote peace in the broader middle east, we must confront regimes that continue to harbor terrorists and pursue weapons of mass murder. syria still allows its territory, and parts of lebanon, to be used by terrorists who seek to destroy every chance of peace in the region. you have passed, and we are applying, the syrian accountability act — and we expect the syrian government to end all support for terror and open the door to freedom.  today, iran remains the world\\'s primary state sponsor of terror — pursuing nuclear weapons while depriving its people of the freedom they seek and deserve. we are working with european allies to make clear to the iranian regime that it must give up its uranium enrichment program and any plutonium reprocessing, and end its support for terror. and to the iranian people, i say tonight: as you stand for your own liberty, america stands with you. our generational commitment to the advance of freedom, especially in the middle east, is now being tested and honored in iraq. that country is a vital front in the war on terror, which is why the terrorists have chosen to make a stand there. our men and women in uniform are fighting terrorists in iraq, so we do not have to face them here at home.  and the victory of freedom in iraq will strengthen a new ally in the war on terror, inspire democratic reformers from damascus to tehran, bring more hope and progress to a troubled region, and thereby lift a terrible threat from the lives of our children and grandchildren.we will succeed because the iraqi people value their own liberty — as they showed the world last sunday.  across iraq, often at great risk, millions of citizens went to the polls and elected 275 men and women to represent them in a new transitional national assembly. a young woman in baghdad told of waking to the sound of mortar fire on election day, and wondering if it might be too dangerous to vote. she said, \"hearing those explosions, it occurred to me — the insurgents are weak, they are afraid of democracy, they are losing. so i got my husband, and i got my parents, and we all came out and voted together.\"americans recognize that spirit of liberty, because we share it. in any nation, casting your vote is an act of civic responsibility; for millions of iraqis, it was also an act of personal courage, and they have earned the respect of us all. one of iraq\\'s leading democracy and human rights advocates is safia taleb al-suhail. she says of her country, \"we were occupied for 35 years by saddam hussein. that was the real occupation. thank you to the american people who paid the cost, but most of all, to the soldiers.\" eleven years ago, safia\\'s father was assassinated by saddam\\'s intelligence service. three days ago in baghdad, safia was finally able to vote for the leaders of her country — and we are honored that she is with us tonight. the terrorists and insurgents are violently opposed to democracy, and will continue to attack it. yet, the terrorists\\' most powerful myth is being destroyed. the whole world is seeing that the car bombers and assassins are not only fighting coalition forces, they are trying to destroy the hopes of iraqis, expressed in free elections. and the whole world now knows that a small group of extremists will not overturn the will of the iraqi people. we will succeed in iraq because iraqis are determined to fight for their own freedom, and to write their own history. as prime minister allawi said in his speech to congress last september, \"ordinary iraqis are anxious to shoulder all the security burdens of our country as quickly as possible.\" that is the natural desire of an independent nation, and it is also the stated mission of our coalition in iraq. the new political situation in iraq opens a new phase of our work in that country.at the recommendation of our commanders on the ground, and in consultation with the iraqi government, we will increasingly focus our efforts on helping prepare more capable iraqi security forces — forces with skilled officers and an effective command structure. as those forces become more self-reliant and take on greater security responsibilities, america and its coalition partners will increasingly be in a supporting role. in the end, iraqis must be able to defend their own country — and we will help that proud, new nation secure its liberty.recently an iraqi interpreter said to a reporter, \"tell america not to abandon us.\" he and all iraqis can be certain: while our military strategy is adapting to circumstances, our commitment remains firm and unchanging. we are standing for the freedom of our iraqi friends, and freedom in iraq will make america safer for generations to come. we will not set an artificial timetable for leaving iraq, because that would embolden the terrorists and make them believe they can wait us out. we are in iraq to achieve a result: a country that is democratic, representative of all its people, at peace with its neighbors, and able to defend itself. and when that result is achieved, our men and women serving in iraq will return home with the honor they have earned. right now, americans in uniform are serving at posts across the world, often taking great risks on my orders. we have given them training and equipment; and they have given us an example of idealism and character that makes every american proud. the volunteers of our military are unrelenting in battle, unwavering in loyalty, unmatched in honor and decency, and every day they\\'re making our nation more secure. some of our servicemen and women have survived terrible injuries, and this grateful country will do everything we can to help them recover. and we have said farewell to some very good men and women, who died for our freedom, and whose memory this nation will honor forever.one name we honor is marine corps sergeant byron norwood of pflugerville, texas, who was killed during the assault on fallujah. his mom, janet, sent me a letter and told me how much byron loved being a marine, and how proud he was to be on the front line against terror. she wrote, \"when byron was home the last time, i said that i wanted to protect him like i had since he was born. he just hugged me and said, \\'you\\'ve done your job, mom. now it is my turn to protect you.\\'\" ladies and gentlemen, with grateful hearts, we honor freedom\\'s defenders, and our military families, represented here this evening by sergeant norwood\\'s mom and dad, janet and bill norwood. in these four years, americans have seen the unfolding of large events. we have known times of sorrow, and hours of uncertainty, and days of victory. in all this history, even when we have disagreed, we have seen threads of purpose that unite us. the attack on freedom in our world has reaffirmed our confidence in freedom\\'s power to change the world. we are all part of a great venture: to extend the promise of freedom in our country, to renew the values that sustain our liberty, and to spread the peace that freedom brings.as franklin roosevelt once reminded americans, \"each age is a dream that is dying, or one that is coming to birth.\" and we live in the country where the biggest dreams are born. the abolition of slavery was only a dream — until it was fulfilled. the liberation of europe from fascism was only a dream — until it was achieved. the fall of imperial communism was only a dream — until, one day, it was accomplished. our generation has dreams of its own, and we also go forward with confidence. the road of providence is uneven and unpredictable — yet we know where it leads: it leads to freedom.thank you, and may god bless america.'\n",
      " 'mr. speaker, vice president cheney, members of congress, members of the supreme court and diplomatic corps, distinguished guests, and fellow citizens:today our nation lost a beloved, graceful, courageous woman who called america to its founding ideals and carried on a noble dream. tonight we are comforted by the hope of a glad reunion with the husband who was taken from her so long ago, and we are grateful for the good life of coretta scott king.each time i am invited to this rostrum, i am humbled by the privilege, and mindful of the history we have seen together. we have gathered under this capitol dome in moments of national mourning and national achievement. we have served america through one of the most consequential periods of our history – and it has been my honor to serve with you.in a system of two parties, two chambers, and two elected branches, there will always be differences and debate. but even tough debates can be conducted in a civil tone, and our differences cannot be allowed to harden into anger. to confront the great issues before us, we must act in a spirit of good will and respect for one another – and i will do my part.  tonight the state of our union is strong – and together we will make it stronger.in this decisive year, you and i will make choices that determine both the future and the character of our country. we will choose to act confidently in pursuing the enemies of freedom – or retreat from our duties in the hope of an easier life. we will choose to build our prosperity by leading the world economy – or shut ourselves off from trade and opportunity. in a complex and challenging time, the road of isolationism and protectionism may seem broad and inviting – yet it ends in danger and decline. the only way to protect our people … the only way to secure the peace … the only way to control our destiny is by our leadership – so the united states of america will continue to lead.abroad, our nation is committed to an historic, long-term goal – we seek the end of tyranny in our world. some dismiss that goal as misguided idealism. in reality, the future security of america depends on it. on september 11th, 2001, we found that problems originating in a failed and oppressive state seven thousand miles away could bring murder and destruction to our country. dictatorships shelter terrorists, feed resentment and radicalism, and seek weapons of mass destruction.  democracies replace resentment with hope, respect the rights of their citizens and their neighbors, and join the fight against terror. every step toward freedom in the world makes our country safer, and so we will act boldly in freedom’s cause.far from being a hopeless dream, the advance of freedom is the great story of our time. in 1945, there were about two dozen lonely democracies on earth. today, there are 122. and we are writing a new chapter in the story of self-government – with women lining up to vote in afghanistan … and millions of iraqis marking their liberty with purple ink … and men and women from lebanon to egypt debating the rights of individuals and the necessity of freedom. at the start of 2006, more than half the people of our world live in democratic nations. and we do not forget the other half – in places like syria, burma, zimbabwe, north korea, and iran – because the demands of justice, and the peace of this world, require their freedom as well.no one can deny the success of freedom, but some men rage and fight against it. and one of the main sources of reaction and opposition is radical islam – the perversion by a few of a noble faith into an ideology of terror and death. terrorists like bin laden are serious about mass murder – and all of us must take their declared intentions seriously.  they seek to impose a heartless system of totalitarian control throughout the middle east, and arm themselves with weapons of mass murder. their aim is to seize power in iraq, and use it as a safe haven to launch attacks against america and the world. lacking the military strength to challenge us directly, the terrorists have chosen the weapon of fear.  when they murder children at a school in beslan … or blow up commuters in london … or behead a bound captive … the terrorists hope these horrors will break our will, allowing the violent to inherit the earth. but they have miscalculated: we love our freedom, and we will fight to keep it.in a time of testing, we cannot find security by abandoning our commitments and retreating within our borders. if we were to leave these vicious attackers alone, they would not leave us alone. they would simply move the battlefield to our own shores. there is no peace in retreat.  and there is no honor in retreat. by allowing radical islam to work its will – by leaving an assaulted world to fend for itself – we would signal to all that we no longer believe in our own ideals, or even in our own courage. but our enemies and our friends can be certain: the united states will not retreat from the world, and we will never surrender to evil.america rejects the false comfort of isolationism. we are the nation that saved liberty in europe, and liberated death camps, and helped raise up democracies, and faced down an evil empire. once again, we accept the call of history to deliver the oppressed, and move this world toward peace.we remain on the offensive against terror networks. we have killed or captured many of their leaders – and for the others, their day will come.we remain on the offensive in afghanistan – where a fine president and national assembly are fighting terror while building the institutions of a new democracy.and we are on the offensive in iraq, with a clear plan for victory.  first, we are helping iraqis build an inclusive government, so that old resentments will be eased, and the insurgency marginalized. second, we are continuing reconstruction efforts, and helping the iraqi government to fight corruption and build a modern economy, so all iraqis can experience the benefits of freedom. third, we are striking terrorist targets while we train iraqi forces that are increasingly capable of defeating the enemy. iraqis are showing their courage every day, and we are proud to be their allies in the cause of freedom.our work in iraq is difficult, because our enemy is brutal. but that brutality has not stopped the dramatic progress of a new democracy. in less than three years, that nation has gone from dictatorship, to liberation, to sovereignty, to a constitution, to national elections. at the same time, our coalition has been relentless in shutting off terrorist infiltration, clearing out insurgent strongholds, and turning over territory to iraqi security forces. i am confident in our plan for victory … i am confident in the will of the iraqi people … i am confident in the skill and spirit of our military. fellow citizens, we are in this fight to win, and we are winning.the road of victory is the road that will take our troops home. as we make progress on the ground, and iraqi forces increasingly take the lead, we should be able to further decrease our troop levels – but those decisions will be made by our military commanders, not by politicians in washington, d.c.our coalition has learned from experience in iraq. we have adjusted our military tactics and changed our approach to reconstruction. along the way, we have benefited from responsible criticism and counsel offered by members of congress of both parties. in the coming year, i will continue to reach out and seek your good advice.yet there is a difference between responsible criticism that aims for success, and defeatism that refuses to acknowledge anything but failure.  hindsight alone is not wisdom. and second-guessing is not a strategy.with so much in the balance, those of us in public office have a duty to speak with candor. a sudden withdrawal of our forces from iraq would abandon our iraqi allies to death and prison … put men like bin laden and zarqawi in charge of a strategic country … and show that a pledge from america means little. members of congress: however we feel about the decisions and debates of the past, our nation has only one option: we must keep our word, defeat our enemies, and stand behind the american military in its vital mission.our men and women in uniform are making sacrifices – and showing a sense of duty stronger than all fear. they know what it is like to fight house to house in a maze of streets … to wear heavy gear in the desert heat … to see a comrade killed by a roadside bomb. and those who know the costs also know the stakes. marine staff sergeant dan clay was killed last month fighting the enemy in fallujah. he left behind a letter to his family, but his words could just as well be addressed to every american.  here is what dan wrote: “i know what honor is. it has been an honor to protect and serve all of you. i faced death with the secure knowledge that you would not have to…. never falter! don’t hesitate to honor and support those of us who have the honor of protecting that which is worth protecting.”staff sergeant dan clay’s wife, lisa, and his mom and dad, sara jo and bud, are with us this evening. our nation is grateful to the fallen, who live in the memory of our country. we are grateful to all who volunteer to wear our nation’s uniform – and as we honor our brave troops, let us never forget the sacrifices of america’s military families.our offensive against terror involves more than military action.  ultimately, the only way to defeat the terrorists is to defeat their dark vision of hatred and fear by offering the hopeful alternative of political freedom and peaceful change. so the united states of america supports democratic reform across the broader middle east. elections are vital – but they are only the beginning. raising up a democracy requires the rule of law, protection of minorities, and strong, accountable institutions that last longer than a single vote. the great people of egypt have voted in a multi-party presidential election – and now their government should open paths of peaceful opposition that will reduce the appeal of radicalism. the palestinian people have voted in elections – now the leaders of hamas must recognize israel, disarm, reject terrorism, and work for lasting peace. saudi arabia has taken the first steps of reform – now it can offer its people a better future by pressing forward with those efforts. democracies in the middle east will not look like our own, because they will reflect the traditions of their own citizens. yet liberty is the future of every nation in the middle east, because liberty is the right and hope of all humanity.the same is true of iran, a nation now held hostage by a small clerical elite that is isolating and repressing its people. the regime in that country sponsors terrorists in the palestinian territories and in lebanon – and that must come to an end. the iranian government is defying the world with its nuclear ambitions – and the nations of the world must not permit the iranian regime to gain nuclear weapons. america will continue to rally the world to confront these threats. and tonight, let me speak directly to the citizens of iran: america respects you, and we respect your country. we respect your right to choose your own future and win your own freedom. and our nation hopes one day to be the closest of friends with a free and democratic iran.to overcome dangers in our world, we must also take the offensive by encouraging economic progress, fighting disease, and spreading hope in hopeless lands. isolationism would not only tie our hands in fighting enemies, it would keep us from helping our friends in desperate need. we show compassion abroad because americans believe in the god-given dignity and worth of a villager with hiv/aids, or an infant with malaria, or a refugee fleeing genocide, or a young girl sold into slavery. we also show compassion abroad because regions overwhelmed by poverty, corruption, and despair are sources of terrorism, organized crime, human trafficking, and the drug trade.in recent years, you and i have taken unprecedented action to fight aids and malaria, expand the education of girls, and reward developing nations that are moving forward with economic and political reform. for people everywhere, the united states is a partner for a better life.  short-changing these efforts would increase the suffering and chaos of our world, undercut our long-term security, and dull the conscience of our country. i urge members of congress to serve the interests of america by showing the compassion of america.our country must also remain on the offensive against terrorism here at home. the enemy has not lost the desire or capability to attack us.  fortunately, this nation has superb professionals in law enforcement, intelligence, the military, and homeland security. these men and women are dedicating their lives to protecting us all, and they deserve our support and our thanks. they also deserve the same tools they already use to fight drug trafficking and organized crime – so i ask you to reauthorize the patriot act.it is said that prior to the attacks of september 11th, our government failed to connect the dots of the conspiracy. we now know that two of the hijackers in the united states placed telephone calls to al-qaida operatives overseas. but we did not know about their plans until it was too late. so to prevent another attack – based on authority given to me by the constitution and by statute – i have authorized a terrorist surveillance program to aggressively pursue the international communications of suspected al-qaida operatives and affiliates to and from america. previous presidents have used the same constitutional authority i have – and federal courts have approved the use of that authority.  appropriate members of congress have been kept informed. this terrorist surveillance program has helped prevent terrorist attacks. it remains essential to the security of america. if there are people inside our country who are talking with al-qaida, we want to know about it – because we will not sit back and wait to be hit again.in all these areas – from the disruption of terror networks, to victory in iraq, to the spread of freedom and hope in troubled regions – we need the support of friends and allies. to draw that support, we must always be clear in our principles and willing to act. the only alternative to american leadership is a dramatically more dangerous and anxious world.  yet we also choose to lead because it is a privilege to serve the values that gave us birth. american leaders – from roosevelt to truman to kennedy to reagan – rejected isolation and retreat, because they knew that america is always more secure when freedom is on the march. our own generation is in a long war against a determined enemy – a war that will be fought by presidents of both parties, who will need steady bipartisan support from the congress. and tonight i ask for yours. together, let us protect our country, support the men and women who defend us, and lead this world toward freedom.here at home, america also has a great opportunity: we will build the prosperity of our country by strengthening our economic leadership in the world.our economy is healthy, and vigorous, and growing faster than other major industrialized nations. in the last two-and-a-half years, america has created 4.6 million new jobs – more than japan and the european union combined. even in the face of higher energy prices and natural disasters, the american people have turned in an economic performance that is the envy of the world.the american economy is pre-eminent – but we cannot afford to be complacent. in a dynamic world economy, we are seeing new competitors like china and india. this creates uncertainty, which makes it easier to feed people’s fears. and so we are seeing some old temptations return.  protectionists want to escape competition, pretending that we can keep our high standard of living while walling off our economy. others say that the government needs to take a larger role in directing the economy, centralizing more power in washington and increasing taxes. we hear claims that immigrants are somehow bad for the economy – even though this economy could not function without them. all these are forms of economic retreat, and they lead in the same direction – toward a stagnant and second-rate economy.tonight i will set out a better path – an agenda for a nation that competes with confidence – an agenda that will raise standards of living and generate new jobs. americans should not fear our economic future, because we intend to shape it.keeping america competitive begins with keeping our economy growing. and our economy grows when americans have more of their own money to spend, save, and invest. in the last five years, the tax relief you passed has left 880 billion dollars in the hands of american workers, investors, small businesses, and families – and they have used it to help produce more than four years of uninterrupted economic growth. yet the tax relief is set to expire in the next few years. if we do nothing, american families will face a massive tax increase they do not expect and will not welcome.because america needs more than a temporary expansion, we need more than temporary tax relief. i urge the congress to act responsibly, and make the tax cuts permanent.keeping america competitive requires us to be good stewards of tax dollars. every year of my presidency, we have reduced the growth of non-security discretionary spending – and last year you passed bills that cut this spending. this year my budget will cut it again, and reduce or eliminate more than 140 programs that are performing poorly or not fulfilling essential priorities. by passing these reforms, we will save the american taxpayer another 14 billion dollars next year – and stay on track to cut the deficit in half by 2009. i am pleased that members of congress are working on earmark reform – because the federal budget has too many special interest projects. and we can tackle this problem together, if you pass the line-item veto.we must also confront the larger challenge of mandatory spending, or entitlements. this year, the first of about 78 million baby boomers turn 60, including two of my dad’s favorite people – me, and president bill clinton. this milestone is more than a personal crisis – it is a national challenge. the retirement of the baby boom generation will put unprecedented strains on the federal government. by 2030, spending for social security, medicare, and medicaid alone will be almost 60 percent of the entire federal budget. and that will present future congresses with impossible choices – staggering tax increases, immense deficits, or deep cuts in every category of spending.congress did not act last year on my proposal to save social security, yet the rising cost of entitlements is a problem that is not going away – and with every year we fail to act, the situation gets worse. so tonight, i ask you to join me in creating a commission to examine the full impact of baby boom retirements on social security, medicare, and medicaid. this commission should include members of congress of both parties, and offer bipartisan answers. we need to put aside partisan politics, work together, and get this problem solved.keeping america competitive requires us to open more markets for all that americans make and grow. one out of every five factory jobs in america is related to global trade, and we want people everywhere to buy american.  with open markets and a level playing field, no one can out-produce or out-compete the american worker.keeping america competitive requires an immigration system that upholds our laws, reflects our values, and serves the interests of our economy.  our nation needs orderly and secure borders. to meet this goal, we must have stronger immigration enforcement and border protection. and we must have a rational, humane guest worker program that rejects amnesty … allows temporary jobs for people who seek them legally … and reduces smuggling and crime at the border.keeping america competitive requires affordable health care. our government has a responsibility to help provide health care for the poor and the elderly, and we are meeting that responsibility. for all americans, we must confront the rising cost of care … strengthen the doctor-patient relationship … and help people afford the insurance coverage they need. we will make wider use of electronic records and other health information technology, to help control costs and reduce dangerous medical errors. we will strengthen health savings accounts – by making sure individuals and small business employees can buy insurance with the same advantages that people working for big businesses now get.  we will do more to make this coverage portable, so workers can switch jobs without having to worry about losing their health insurance. and because lawsuits are driving many good doctors out of practice – leaving women in nearly 1,500 american counties without a single ob-gyn – i ask the congress to pass medical liability reform this year.keeping america competitive requires affordable energy. here we have a serious problem: america is addicted to oil, which is often imported from unstable parts of the world.the best way to break this addiction is through technology. since 2001, we have spent nearly 10 billion dollars to develop cleaner, cheaper, more reliable alternative energy sources – and we are on the threshold of incredible advances. so tonight, i announce the advanced energy initiative – a 22-percent increase in clean-energy research at the department of energy, to push for breakthroughs in two vital areas. to change how we power our homes and offices, we will invest more in zero-emission coal-fired plants; revolutionary solar and wind technologies; and clean, safe nuclear energy.we must also change how we power our automobiles. we will increase our research in better batteries for hybrid and electric cars, and in pollution-free cars that run on hydrogen. we will also fund additional research in cutting-edge methods of producing ethanol, not just from corn but from wood chips, stalks, or switch grass. our goal is to make this new kind of ethanol practical and competitive within six years.  breakthroughs on this and other new technologies will help us reach another great goal: to replace more than 75 percent of our oil imports from the middle east by 2025. by applying the talent and technology of america, this country can dramatically improve our environment … move beyond a petroleum-based economy … and make our dependence on middle eastern oil a thing of the past.and to keep america competitive, one commitment is necessary above all: we must continue to lead the world in human talent and creativity. our greatest advantage in the world has always been our educated, hard-working, ambitious people – and we are going to keep that edge.  tonight i announce the american competitiveness initiative, to encourage innovation throughout our economy, and to give our nation’s children a firm grounding in math and science.first: i propose to double the federal commitment to the most critical basic research programs in the physical sciences over the next ten years.  this funding will support the work of america’s most creative minds as they explore promising areas such as nanotechnology, supercomputing, and alternative energy sources.second: i propose to make permanent the research and development tax credit, to encourage bolder private-sector investment in technology. with more research in both the public and private sectors, we will improve our quality of life – and ensure that america will lead the world in opportunity and innovation for decades to come.third: we need to encourage children to take more math and science, and make sure those courses are rigorous enough to compete with other nations.  we have made a good start in the early grades with the no child left behind act, which is raising standards and lifting test scores across our country. tonight i propose to train 70,000 high school teachers, to lead advanced-placement courses in math and science … bring 30,000 math and science professionals to teach in classrooms … and give early help to students who struggle with math, so they have a better chance at good, high-wage jobs. if we ensure that america’s children succeed in life, they will ensure that america succeeds in the world.preparing our nation to compete in the world is a goal that all of us can share. i urge you to support the american competitiveness initiative … and together we will show the world what the american people can achieve.america is a great force for freedom and prosperity. yet our greatness is not measured in power or luxuries, but by who we are and how we treat one another. so we strive to be a compassionate, decent, hopeful society.in recent years, america has become a more hopeful nation. violent crime rates have fallen to their lowest levels since the 1970s. welfare cases have dropped by more than half over the past decade. drug use among youth is down 19 percent since 2001. there are fewer abortions in america than at any point in the last three decades, and the number of children born to teenage mothers has been falling for a dozen years in a row.these gains are evidence of a quiet transformation – a revolution of conscience, in which a rising generation is finding that a life of personal responsibility is a life of fulfillment. government has played a role. wise policies such as welfare reform, drug education, and support for abstinence and adoption have made a difference in the character of our country. and everyone here tonight, democrat and republican, has a right to be proud of this record.yet many americans, especially parents, still have deep concerns about the direction of our culture, and the health of our most basic institutions.  they are concerned about unethical conduct by public officials, and discouraged by activist courts that try to redefine marriage. and they worry about children in our society who need direction and love … and about fellow citizens still displaced by natural disaster … and about suffering caused by treatable diseases.as we look at these challenges, we must never give in to the belief that america is in decline, or that our culture is doomed to unravel. the american people know better than that. we have proven the pessimists wrong before – and we will do it again.a hopeful society depends on courts that deliver equal justice under law.  the supreme court now has two superb new members, chief justice john roberts and justice sam alito. i thank the senate for confirming both of them. and i will continue to nominate men and women who understand that judges must be servants of the law, and not legislate from the bench.  today marks the official retirement of a very special american. for 24 years of faithful service to our nation, the united states is grateful to justice sandra day o’connor.a hopeful society has institutions of science and medicine that do not cut ethical corners, and that recognize the matchless value of every life.  tonight i ask you to pass legislation to prohibit the most egregious abuses of medical research – human cloning in all its forms … creating or implanting embryos for experiments … creating human-animal hybrids … and buying, selling, or patenting human embryos. human life is a gift from our creator – and that gift should never be discarded, devalued, or put up for sale.a hopeful society expects elected officials to uphold the public trust.  honorable people in both parties are working on reforms to strengthen the ethical standards of washington – and i support your efforts. each of us has made a pledge to be worthy of public responsibility – and that is a pledge we must never forget, never dismiss, and never betray.as we renew the promise of our institutions, let us also show the character of america in our compassion and care for one another.a hopeful society gives special attention to children who lack direction and love. through the helping america’s youth initiative, we are encouraging caring adults to get involved in the life of a child – and this good work is led by our first lady, laura bush. this year we will add resources to encourage young people to stay in school – so more of america’s youth can raise their sights and achieve their dreams.a hopeful society comes to the aid of fellow citizens in times of suffering and emergency – and stays at it until they are back on their feet. so far the federal government has committed 85 billion dollars to the people of the gulf coast and new orleans. we are removing debris, repairing highways, and building stronger levees. we are providing business loans and housing assistance. yet as we meet these immediate needs, we must also address deeper challenges that existed before the storm arrived. in new orleans and in other places, many of our fellow citizens have felt excluded from the promise of our country. the answer is not only temporary relief, but schools that teach every child … and job skills that bring upward mobility … and more opportunities to own a home and start a business. as we recover from a disaster, let us also work for the day when all americans are protected by justice, equal in hope, and rich in opportunity.a hopeful society acts boldly to fight diseases like hiv/aids, which can be prevented, and treated, and defeated. more than a million americans live with hiv, and half of all aids cases occur among african-americans.  i ask congress to reform and reauthorize the ryan white act … and provide new funding to states, so we end the waiting lists for aids medicine in america. we will also lead a nationwide effort, working closely with african-american churches and faith-based groups, to deliver rapid hiv tests to millions, end the stigma of aids, and come closer to the day when there are no new infections in america.fellow citizens, we have been called to leadership in a period of consequence. we have entered a great ideological conflict we did nothing to invite. we see great changes in science and commerce that will influence all our lives. and sometimes it can seem that history is turning in a wide arc, toward an unknown shore.yet the destination of history is determined by human action, and every great movement of history comes to a point of choosing. lincoln could have accepted peace at the cost of disunity and continued slavery. martin luther king could have stopped at birmingham or at selma, and achieved only half a victory over segregation. the united states could have accepted the permanent division of europe, and been complicit in the oppression of others. today, having come far in our own historical journey, we must decide: will we turn back, or finish well?before history is written down in books, it is written in courage.  like americans before us, we will show that courage and we will finish well. we will lead freedom’s advance. we will compete and excel in the global economy. we will renew the defining moral commitments of this land. and so we move forward – optimistic about our country, faithful to its cause, and confident of victories to come.thank you, god bless you, and may god bless america.'\n",
      " 'thank you very much. and tonight, i have a high privilege and distinct honor of my own — as the first president to begin the state of the union message with these words: madam speaker (applause.)in his day, the late congressman thomas d\\'alesandro, jr. from baltimore, maryland, saw presidents roosevelt and truman at this rostrum. but nothing could compare with the sight of his only daughter, nancy, presiding tonight as speaker of the house of representatives. (applause.) congratulations, madam speaker. (applause.) two members of the house and senate are not with us tonight, and we pray for the recovery and speedy return of senator tim johnson and congressman charlie norwood. (applause.) madam speaker, vice president cheney, members of congress, distinguished guests, and fellow citizens: the rite of custom brings us together at a defining hour — when decisions are hard and courage is needed. we enter the year 2007 with large endeavors underway, and others that are ours to begin. in all of this, much is asked of us. we must have the will to face difficult challenges and determined enemies — and the wisdom to face them together. some in this chamber are new to the house and the senate — and i congratulate the democrat majority. (applause.) congress has changed, but not our responsibilities. each of us is guided by our own convictions — and to these we must stay faithful. yet we\\'re all held to the same standards, and called to serve the same good purposes: to extend this nation\\'s prosperity; to spend the people\\'s money wisely; to solve problems, not leave them to future generations; to guard america against all evil; and to keep faith with those we have sent forth to defend us. (applause.) we\\'re not the first to come here with a government divided and uncertainty in the air. like many before us, we can work through our differences, and achieve big things for the american people. our citizens don\\'t much care which side of the aisle we sit on — as long as we\\'re willing to cross that aisle when there is work to be done. (applause.) our job is to make life better for our fellow americans, and to help them to build a future of hope and opportunity — and this is the business before us tonight. a future of hope and opportunity begins with a growing economy — and that is what we have. we\\'re now in the 41st month of uninterrupted job growth, in a recovery that has created 7.2 million new jobs — so far. unemployment is low, inflation is low, and wages are rising. this economy is on the move, and our job is to keep it that way, not with more government, but with more enterprise. (applause.) next week, i\\'ll deliver a full report on the state of our economy. tonight, i want to discuss three economic reforms that deserve to be priorities for this congress. first, we must balance the federal budget. (applause.) we can do so without raising taxes. (applause.) what we need is impose spending discipline in washington, d.c. we set a goal of cutting the deficit in half by 2009, and met that goal three years ahead of schedule. (applause.) now let us take the next step. in the coming weeks, i will submit a budget that eliminates the federal deficit within the next five years. (applause.) i ask you to make the same commitment. together, we can restrain the spending appetite of the federal government, and we can balance the federal budget. (applause.) next, there is the matter of earmarks. these special interest items are often slipped into bills at the last hour — when not even c-span is watching. (laughter.) in 2005 alone, the number of earmarks grew to over 13,000 and totaled nearly $18 billion. even worse, over 90 percent of earmarks never make it to the floor of the house and senate — they are dropped into committee reports that are not even part of the bill that arrives on my desk. you didn\\'t vote them into law. i didn\\'t sign them into law. yet, they\\'re treated as if they have the force of law. the time has come to end this practice. so let us work together to reform the budget process, expose every earmark to the light of day and to a vote in congress, and cut the number and cost of earmarks at least in half by the end of this session. (applause.) and, finally, to keep this economy strong we must take on the challenge of entitlements. social security and medicare and medicaid are commitments of conscience, and so it is our duty to keep them permanently sound. yet, we\\'re failing in that duty. and this failure will one day leave our children with three bad options: huge tax increases, huge deficits, or huge and immediate cuts in benefits. everyone in this chamber knows this to be true — yet somehow we have not found it in ourselves to act. so let us work together and do it now. with enough good sense and goodwill, you and i can fix medicare and medicaid — and save social security. (applause.) spreading opportunity and hope in america also requires public schools that give children the knowledge and character they need in life. five years ago, we rose above partisan differences to pass the no child left behind act, preserving local control, raising standards, and holding those schools accountable for results. and because we acted, students are performing better in reading and math, and minority students are closing the achievement gap. now the task is to build on the success, without watering down standards, without taking control from local communities, and without backsliding and calling it reform. we can lift student achievement even higher by giving local leaders flexibility to turn around failing schools, and by giving families with children stuck in failing schools the right to choose someplace better. (applause.) we must increase funds for students who struggle — and make sure these children get the special help they need. (applause.) and we can make sure our children are prepared for the jobs of the future and our country is more competitive by strengthening math and science skills. the no child left behind act has worked for america\\'s children — and i ask congress to reauthorize this good law. (applause.) a future of hope and opportunity requires that all our citizens have affordable and available health care. (applause.) when it comes to health care, government has an obligation to care for the elderly, the disabled, and poor children. and we will meet those responsibilities. for all other americans, private health insurance is the best way to meet their needs. (applause.) but many americans cannot afford a health insurance policy. and so tonight, i propose two new initiatives to help more americans afford their own insurance. first, i propose a standard tax deduction for health insurance that will be like the standard tax deduction for dependents. families with health insurance will pay no income on payroll tax — or payroll taxes on $15,000 of their income. single americans with health insurance will pay no income or payroll taxes on $7,500 of their income. with this reform, more than 100 million men, women, and children who are now covered by employer-provided insurance will benefit from lower tax bills. at the same time, this reform will level the playing field for those who do not get health insurance through their job. for americans who now purchase health insurance on their own, this proposal would mean a substantial tax savings — $4,500 for a family of four making $60,000 a year. and for the millions of other americans who have no health insurance at all, this deduction would help put a basic private health insurance plan within their reach. changing the tax code is a vital and necessary step to making health care affordable for more americans. (applause.)my second proposal is to help the states that are coming up with innovative ways to cover the uninsured. states that make basic private health insurance available to all their citizens should receive federal funds to help them provide this coverage to the poor and the sick. i have asked the secretary of health and human services to work with congress to take existing federal funds and use them to create \"affordable choices\" grants. these grants would give our nation\\'s governors more money and more flexibility to get private health insurance to those most in need. there are many other ways that congress can help. we need to expand health savings accounts. (applause.) we need to help small businesses through association health plans. (applause.) we need to reduce costs and medical errors with better information technology. (applause.) we will encourage price transparency. and to protect good doctors from junk lawsuits, we passing medical liability reform. (applause.) in all we do, we must remember that the best health care decisions are made not by government and insurance companies, but by patients and their doctors. (applause.) extending hope and opportunity in our country requires an immigration system worthy of america — with laws that are fair and borders that are secure. when laws and borders are routinely violated, this harms the interests of our country. to secure our border, we\\'re doubling the size of the border patrol, and funding new infrastructure and technology. yet even with all these steps, we cannot fully secure the border unless we take pressure off the border — and that requires a temporary worker program. we should establish a legal and orderly path for foreign workers to enter our country to work on a temporary basis. as a result, they won\\'t have to try to sneak in, and that will leave border agents free to chase down drug smugglers and criminals and terrorists. (applause.) we\\'ll enforce our immigration laws at the work site and give employers the tools to verify the legal status of their workers, so there\\'s no excuse left for violating the law. (applause.) we need to uphold the great tradition of the melting pot that welcomes and assimilates new arrivals. (applause.) we need to resolve the status of the illegal immigrants who are already in our country without animosity and without amnesty. (applause.) convictions run deep in this capitol when it comes to immigration. let us have a serious, civil, and conclusive debate, so that you can pass, and i can sign, comprehensive immigration reform into law. (applause.) extending hope and opportunity depends on a stable supply of energy that keeps america\\'s economy running and america\\'s environment clean. for too long our nation has been dependent on foreign oil. and this dependence leaves us more vulnerable to hostile regimes, and to terrorists — who could cause huge disruptions of oil shipments, and raise the price of oil, and do great harm to our economy. it\\'s in our vital interest to diversify america\\'s energy supply — the way forward is through technology. we must continue changing the way america generates electric power, by even greater use of clean coal technology, solar and wind energy, and clean, safe nuclear power. (applause.) we need to press on with battery research for plug-in and hybrid vehicles, and expand the use of clean diesel vehicles and biodiesel fuel. (applause.) we must continue investing in new methods of producing ethanol — (applause) — using everything from wood chips to grasses, to agricultural wastes. we made a lot of progress, thanks to good policies here in washington and the strong response of the market. and now even more dramatic advances are within reach. tonight, i ask congress to join me in pursuing a great goal. let us build on the work we\\'ve done and reduce gasoline usage in the united states by 20 percent in the next 10 years. (applause.) when we do that we will have cut our total imports by the equivalent of three-quarters of all the oil we now import from the middle east. to reach this goal, we must increase the supply of alternative fuels, by setting a mandatory fuels standard to require 35 billion gallons of renewable and alternative fuels in 2017 — and that is nearly five times the current target. (applause.) at the same time, we need to reform and modernize fuel economy standards for cars the way we did for light trucks — and conserve up to 8.5 billion more gallons of gasoline by 2017. achieving these ambitious goals will dramatically reduce our dependence on foreign oil, but it\\'s not going to eliminate it. and so as we continue to diversify our fuel supply, we must step up domestic oil production in environmentally sensitive ways. (applause.) and to further protect america against severe disruptions to our oil supply, i ask congress to double the current capacity of the strategic petroleum reserve. (applause.) america is on the verge of technological breakthroughs that will enable us to live our lives less dependent on oil. and these technologies will help us be better stewards of the environment, and they will help us to confront the serious challenge of global climate change. (applause.) a future of hope and opportunity requires a fair, impartial system of justice. the lives of our citizens across our nation are affected by the outcome of cases pending in our federal courts. we have a shared obligation to ensure that the federal courts have enough judges to hear those cases and deliver timely rulings. as president, i have a duty to nominate qualified men and women to vacancies on the federal bench. and the united states senate has a duty, as well, to give those nominees a fair hearing, and a prompt up-or-down vote on the senate floor. (applause.) for all of us in this room, there is no higher responsibility than to protect the people of this country from danger. five years have come and gone since we saw the scenes and felt the sorrow that the terrorists can cause. we\\'ve had time to take stock of our situation. we\\'ve added many critical protections to guard the homeland. we know with certainty that the horrors of that september morning were just a glimpse of what the terrorists intend for us — unless we stop them. with the distance of time, we find ourselves debating the causes of conflict and the course we have followed. such debates are essential when a great democracy faces great questions. yet one question has surely been settled: that to win the war on terror we must take the fight to the enemy. (applause.) from the start, america and our allies have protected our people by staying on the offense. the enemy knows that the days of comfortable sanctuary, easy movement, steady financing, and free flowing communications are long over. for the terrorists, life since 9/11 has never been the same. our success in this war is often measured by the things that did not happen. we cannot know the full extent of the attacks that we and our allies have prevented, but here is some of what we do know: we stopped an al qaeda plot to fly a hijacked airplane into the tallest building on the west coast. we broke up a southeast asian terror cell grooming operatives for attacks inside the united states. we uncovered an al qaeda cell developing anthrax to be used in attacks against america. and just last august, british authorities uncovered a plot to blow up passenger planes bound for america over the atlantic ocean. for each life saved, we owe a debt of gratitude to the brave public servants who devote their lives to finding the terrorists and stopping them. (applause.) every success against the terrorists is a reminder of the shoreless ambitions of this enemy. the evil that inspired and rejoiced in 9/11 is still at work in the world. and so long as that\\'s the case, america is still a nation at war. in the mind of the terrorist, this war began well before september the 11th, and will not end until their radical vision is fulfilled. and these past five years have given us a much clearer view of the nature of this enemy. al qaeda and its followers are sunni extremists, possessed by hatred and commanded by a harsh and narrow ideology. take almost any principle of civilization, and their goal is the opposite. they preach with threats, instruct with bullets and bombs, and promise paradise for the murder of the innocent. our enemies are quite explicit about their intentions. they want to overthrow moderate governments, and establish safe havens from which to plan and carry out new attacks on our country. by killing and terrorizing americans, they want to force our country to retreat from the world and abandon the cause of liberty. they would then be free to impose their will and spread their totalitarian ideology. listen to this warning from the late terrorist zarqawi: \"we will sacrifice our blood and bodies to put an end to your dreams, and what is coming is even worse.\" osama bin laden declared: \"death is better than living on this earth with the unbelievers among us.\" these men are not given to idle words, and they are just one camp in the islamist radical movement. in recent times, it has also become clear that we face an escalating danger from shia extremists who are just as hostile to america, and are also determined to dominate the middle east. many are known to take direction from the regime in iran, which is funding and arming terrorists like hezbollah — a group second only to al qaeda in the american lives it has taken. the shia and sunni extremists are different faces of the same totalitarian threat. whatever slogans they chant, when they slaughter the innocent they have the same wicked purposes. they want to kill americans, kill democracy in the middle east, and gain the weapons to kill on an even more horrific scale. in the sixth year since our nation was attacked, i wish i could report to you that the dangers had ended. they have not. and so it remains the policy of this government to use every lawful and proper tool of intelligence, diplomacy, law enforcement, and military action to do our duty, to find these enemies, and to protect the american people. (applause.) this war is more than a clash of arms — it is a decisive ideological struggle, and the security of our nation is in the balance. to prevail, we must remove the conditions that inspire blind hatred, and drove 19 men to get onto airplanes and to come and kill us. what every terrorist fears most is human freedom — societies where men and women make their own choices, answer to their own conscience, and live by their hopes instead of their resentments. free people are not drawn to violent and malignant ideologies — and most will choose a better way when they\\'re given a chance. so we advance our own security interests by helping moderates and reformers and brave voices for democracy. the great question of our day is whether america will help men and women in the middle east to build free societies and share in the rights of all humanity. and i say, for the sake of our own security, we must. (applause.) in the last two years, we\\'ve seen the desire for liberty in the broader middle east — and we have been sobered by the enemy\\'s fierce reaction. in 2005, the world watched as the citizens of lebanon raised the banner of the cedar revolution, they drove out the syrian occupiers and chose new leaders in free elections. in 2005, the people of afghanistan defied the terrorists and elected a democratic legislature. and in 2005, the iraqi people held three national elections, choosing a transitional government, adopting the most progressive, democratic constitution in the arab world, and then electing a government under that constitution. despite endless threats from the killers in their midst, nearly 12 million iraqi citizens came out to vote in a show of hope and solidarity that we should never forget. (applause.) a thinking enemy watched all of these scenes, adjusted their tactics, and in 2006 they struck back. in lebanon, assassins took the life of pierre gemayel, a prominent participant in the cedar revolution. hezbollah terrorists, with support from syria and iran, sowed conflict in the region and are seeking to undermine lebanon\\'s legitimately elected government. in afghanistan, taliban and al qaeda fighters tried to regain power by regrouping and engaging afghan and nato forces. in iraq, al qaeda and other sunni extremists blew up one of the most sacred places in shia islam — the golden mosque of samarra. this atrocity, directed at a muslim house of prayer, was designed to provoke retaliation from iraqi shia — and it succeeded. radical shia elements, some of whom receive support from iran, formed death squads. the result was a tragic escalation of sectarian rage and reprisal that continues to this day. this is not the fight we entered in iraq, but it is the fight we\\'re in. every one of us wishes this war were over and won. yet it would not be like us to leave our promises unkept, our friends abandoned, and our own security at risk. (applause.) ladies and gentlemen: on this day, at this hour, it is still within our power to shape the outcome of this battle. let us find our resolve, and turn events toward victory. (applause.) we\\'re carrying out a new strategy in iraq — a plan that demands more from iraq\\'s elected government, and gives our forces in iraq the reinforcements they need to complete their mission. our goal is a democratic iraq that upholds the rule of law, respects the rights of its people, provides them security, and is an ally in the war on terror. in order to make progress toward this goal, the iraqi government must stop the sectarian violence in its capital. but the iraqis are not yet ready to do this on their own. so we\\'re deploying reinforcements of more than 20,000 additional soldiers and marines to iraq. the vast majority will go to baghdad, where they will help iraqi forces to clear and secure neighborhoods, and serve as advisers embedded in iraqi army units. with iraqis in the lead, our forces will help secure the city by chasing down the terrorists, insurgents, and the roaming death squads. and in anbar province, where al qaeda terrorists have gathered and local forces have begun showing a willingness to fight them, we\\'re sending an additional 4,000 united states marines, with orders to find the terrorists and clear them out. (applause.) we didn\\'t drive al qaeda out of their safe haven in afghanistan only to let them set up a new safe haven in a free iraq. the people of iraq want to live in peace, and now it\\'s time for their government to act. iraq\\'s leaders know that our commitment is not open-ended. they have promised to deploy more of their own troops to secure baghdad — and they must do so. they pledged that they will confront violent radicals of any faction or political party — and they need to follow through, and lift needless restrictions on iraqi and coalition forces, so these troops can achieve their mission of bringing security to all of the people of baghdad. iraq\\'s leaders have committed themselves to a series of benchmarks — to achieve reconciliation, to share oil revenues among all of iraq\\'s citizens, to put the wealth of iraq into the rebuilding of iraq, to allow more iraqis to re-enter their nation\\'s civic life, to hold local elections, and to take responsibility for security in every iraqi province. but for all of this to happen, baghdad must be secure. and our plan will help the iraqi government take back its capital and make good on its commitments. my fellow citizens, our military commanders and i have carefully weighed the options. we discussed every possible approach. in the end, i chose this course of action because it provides the best chance for success. many in this chamber understand that america must not fail in iraq, because you understand that the consequences of failure would be grievous and far-reaching. if american forces step back before baghdad is secure, the iraqi government would be overrun by extremists on all sides. we could expect an epic battle between shia extremists backed by iran, and sunni extremists aided by al qaeda and supporters of the old regime. a contagion of violence could spill out across the country — and in time, the entire region could be drawn into the conflict. for america, this is a nightmare scenario. for the enemy, this is the objective. chaos is the greatest ally — their greatest ally in this struggle. and out of chaos in iraq would emerge an emboldened enemy with new safe havens, new recruits, new resources, and an even greater determination to harm america. to allow this to happen would be to ignore the lessons of september the 11th and invite tragedy. ladies and gentlemen, nothing is more important at this moment in our history than for america to succeed in the middle east, to succeed in iraq and to spare the american people from this danger. (applause.) this is where matters stand tonight, in the here and now. i have spoken with many of you in person. i respect you and the arguments you\\'ve made. we went into this largely united, in our assumptions and in our convictions. and whatever you voted for, you did not vote for failure. our country is pursuing a new strategy in iraq, and i ask you to give it a chance to work. and i ask you to support our troops in the field, and those on their way. (applause.) the war on terror we fight today is a generational struggle that will continue long after you and i have turned our duties over to others. and that\\'s why it\\'s important to work together so our nation can see this great effort through. both parties and both branches should work in close consultation. it\\'s why i propose to establish a special advisory council on the war on terror, made up of leaders in congress from both political parties. we will share ideas for how to position america to meet every challenge that confronts us. we\\'ll show our enemies abroad that we are united in the goal of victory. and one of the first steps we can take together is to add to the ranks of our military so that the american armed forces are ready for all the challenges ahead. (applause.) tonight i ask the congress to authorize an increase in the size of our active army and marine corps by 92,000 in the next five years. (applause.) a second task we can take on together is to design and establish a volunteer civilian reserve corps. such a corps would function much like our military reserve. it would ease the burden on the armed forces by allowing us to hire civilians with critical skills to serve on missions abroad when america needs them. it would give people across america who do not wear the uniform a chance to serve in the defining struggle of our time. americans can have confidence in the outcome of this struggle because we\\'re not in this struggle alone. we have a diplomatic strategy that is rallying the world to join in the fight against extremism. in iraq, multinational forces are operating under a mandate from the united nations. we\\'re working with jordan and saudi arabia and egypt and the gulf states to increase support for iraq\\'s government. the united nations has imposed sanctions on iran, and made it clear that the world will not allow the regime in tehran to acquire nuclear weapons. (applause.) with the other members of the quartet — the u.n., the european union, and russia — we\\'re pursuing diplomacy to help bring peace to the holy land, and pursuing the establishment of a democratic palestinian state living side-by-side with israel in peace and security. (applause.) in afghanistan, nato has taken the lead in turning back the taliban and al qaeda offensive — the first time the alliance has deployed forces outside the north atlantic area. together with our partners in china, japan, russia, and south korea, we\\'re pursuing intensive diplomacy to achieve a korean peninsula free of nuclear weapons. (applause.) we will continue to speak out for the cause of freedom in places like cuba, belarus, and burma [1] — and continue to awaken the conscience of the world to save the people of darfur. (applause.) american foreign policy is more than a matter of war and diplomacy. our work in the world is also based on a timeless truth: to whom much is given, much is required. we hear the call to take on the challenges of hunger and poverty and disease — and that is precisely what america is doing. we must continue to fight hiv/aids, especially on the continent of africa. (applause.) because you funded our emergency plan for aids relief, the number of people receiving life-saving drugs has grown from 50,000 to more than 800,000 in three short years. i ask you to continue funding our efforts to fight hiv/aids. i ask you to provide $1.2 billion over five years so we can combat malaria in 15 african countries. (applause.) i ask that you fund the millennium challenge account, so that american aid reaches the people who need it, in nations where democracy is on the rise and corruption is in retreat. and let us continue to support the expanded trade and debt relief that are the best hope for lifting lives and eliminating poverty. (applause.) when america serves others in this way, we show the strength and generosity of our country. these deeds reflect the character of our people. the greatest strength we have is the heroic kindness, courage, and self-sacrifice of the american people. you see this spirit often if you know where to look — and tonight we need only look above to the gallery. dikembe mutombo grew up in africa, amid great poverty and disease. he came to georgetown university on a scholarship to study medicine — but coach john thompson got a look at dikembe and had a different idea. (laughter.) dikembe became a star in the nba, and a citizen of the united states. but he never forgot the land of his birth, or the duty to share his blessings with others. he built a brand new hospital in his old hometown. a friend has said of this good-hearted man: \"mutombo believes that god has given him this opportunity to do great things.\" and we are proud to call this son of the congo [2] a citizen of the united states of america. (applause.) after her daughter was born, julie aigner-clark searched for ways to share her love of music and art with her child. so she borrowed some equipment, and began filming children\\'s videos in her basement. the baby einstein company was born, and in just five years her business grew to more than $20 million in sales. in november 2001, julie sold baby einstein to the walt disney company, and with her help baby einstein has grown into a $200 million business. julie represents the great enterprising spirit of america. and she is using her success to help others — producing child safety videos with john walsh of the national center for missing and exploited children. julie says of her new project: \"i believe it\\'s the most important thing that i have ever done. i believe that children have the right to live in a world that is safe.\" and so tonight, we are pleased to welcome this talented business entrepreneur and generous social entrepreneur — julie aigner-clark. (applause.) three weeks ago, wesley autrey was waiting at a harlem subway station with his two little girls, when he saw a man fall into the path of a train. with seconds to act, wesley jumped onto the tracks, pulled the man into the space between the rails, and held him as the train passed right above their heads. he insists he\\'s not a hero. he says: \"we got guys and girls overseas dying for us to have our freedoms. we have got to show each other some love.\" there is something wonderful about a country that produces a brave and humble man like wesley autrey. (applause.) tommy rieman was a teenager pumping gas in independence, kentucky, when he enlisted in the united states army. in december 2003, he was on a reconnaissance mission in iraq when his team came under heavy enemy fire. from his humvee, sergeant rieman returned fire; he used his body as a shield to protect his gunner. he was shot in the chest and arm, and received shrapnel wounds to his legs — yet he refused medical attention, and stayed in the fight. he helped to repel a second attack, firing grenades at the enemy\\'s position. for his exceptional courage, sergeant rieman was awarded the silver star. and like so many other americans who have volunteered to defend us, he has earned the respect and the gratitude of our entire country. (applause.) in such courage and compassion, ladies and gentlemen, we see the spirit and character of america — and these qualities are not in short supply. this is a decent and honorable country — and resilient, too. we\\'ve been through a lot together. we\\'ve met challenges and faced dangers, and we know that more lie ahead. yet we can go forward with confidence — because the state of our union is strong, our cause in the world is right, and tonight that cause goes on. god bless. (applause.) see you next year. thank you for your prayers.'\n",
      " 'the president: madam speaker, vice president cheney, members of congress, distinguished guests, and fellow citizens: seven years have passed since i first stood before you at this rostrum. in that time, our country has been tested in ways none of us could have imagined. we faced hard decisions about peace and war, rising competition in the world economy, and the health and welfare of our citizens. these issues call for vigorous debate, and i think it\\'s fair to say we\\'ve answered the call. yet history will record that amid our differences, we acted with purpose. and together, we showed the world the power and resilience of american self-government.all of us were sent to washington to carry out the people\\'s business. that is the purpose of this body. it is the meaning of our oath. it remains our charge to keep.the actions of the 110th congress will affect the security and prosperity of our nation long after this session has ended. in this election year, let us show our fellow americans that we recognize our responsibilities and are determined to meet them. let us show them that republicans and democrats can compete for votes and cooperate for results at the same time. (applause.)from expanding opportunity to protecting our country, we\\'ve made good progress. yet we have unfinished business before us, and the american people expect us to get it done.in the work ahead, we must be guided by the philosophy that made our nation great. as americans, we believe in the power of individuals to determine their destiny and shape the course of history. we believe that the most reliable guide for our country is the collective wisdom of ordinary citizens. and so in all we do, we must trust in the ability of free peoples to make wise decisions, and empower them to improve their lives for their futures.to build a prosperous future, we must trust people with their own money and empower them to grow our economy. as we meet tonight, our economy is undergoing a period of uncertainty. america has added jobs for a record 52 straight months, but jobs are now growing at a slower pace. wages are up, but so are prices for food and gas. exports are rising, but the housing market has declined. at kitchen tables across our country, there is a concern about our economic future.in the long run, americans can be confident about our economic growth. but in the short run, we can all see that that growth is slowing. so last week, my administration reached agreement with speaker pelosi and republican leader boehner on a robust growth package that includes tax relief for individuals and families and incentives for business investment. the temptation will be to load up the bill. that would delay it or derail it, and neither option is acceptable. (applause.) this is a good agreement that will keep our economy growing and our people working. and this congress must pass it as soon as possible. (applause.)we have other work to do on taxes. unless congress acts, most of the tax relief we\\'ve delivered over the past seven years will be taken away. some in washington argue that letting tax relief expire is not a tax increase. try explaining that to 116 million american taxpayers who would see their taxes rise by an average of $1,800. others have said they would personally be happy to pay higher taxes. i welcome their enthusiasm. i\\'m pleased to report that the irs accepts both checks and money orders. (laughter and applause.)most americans think their taxes are high enough. with all the other pressures on their finances, american families should not have to worry about their federal government taking a bigger bite out of their paychecks. there\\'s only one way to eliminate this uncertainty: make the tax relief permanent. (applause.) and members of congress should know: if any bill raises taxes reaches my desk, i will veto it. (applause.)just as we trust americans with their own money, we need to earn their trust by spending their tax dollars wisely. next week, i\\'ll send you a budget that terminates or substantially reduces 151 wasteful or bloated programs, totaling more than $18 billion. the budget that i will submit will keep america on track for a surplus in 2012. american families have to balance their budgets; so should their government. (applause.)the people\\'s trust in their government is undermined by congressional earmarks — special interest projects that are often snuck in at the last minute, without discussion or debate. last year, i asked you to voluntarily cut the number and cost of earmarks in half. i also asked you to stop slipping earmarks into committee reports that never even come to a vote. unfortunately, neither goal was met. so this time, if you send me an appropriations bill that does not cut the number and cost of earmarks in half, i\\'ll send it back to you with my veto. (applause.)and tomorrow, i will issue an executive order that directs federal agencies to ignore any future earmark that is not voted on by congress. if these items are truly worth funding, congress should debate them in the open and hold a public vote. (applause.)our shared responsibilities extend beyond matters of taxes and spending. on housing, we must trust americans with the responsibility of homeownership and empower them to weather turbulent times in the housing market. my administration brought together the hope now alliance, which is helping many struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure. and congress can help even more. tonight i ask you to pass legislation to reform fannie mae and freddie mac, modernize the federal housing administration, and allow state housing agencies to issue tax-free bonds to help homeowners refinance their mortgages. (applause.) these are difficult times for many american families, and by taking these steps, we can help more of them keep their homes.to build a future of quality health care, we must trust patients and doctors to make medical decisions and empower them with better information and better options. we share a common goal: making health care more affordable and accessible for all americans. (applause.) the best way to achieve that goal is by expanding consumer choice, not government control. (applause.) so i have proposed ending the bias in the tax code against those who do not get their health insurance through their employer. this one reform would put private coverage within reach for millions, and i call on the congress to pass it this year. (applause.)the congress must also expand health savings accounts, create association health plans for small businesses, promote health information technology, and confront the epidemic of junk medical lawsuits. (applause.) with all these steps, we will help ensure that decisions about your medical care are made in the privacy of your doctor\\'s office — not in the halls of congress. (applause.)on education, we must trust students to learn if given the chance, and empower parents to demand results from our schools. in neighborhoods across our country, there are boys and girls with dreams — and a decent education is their only hope of achieving them.six years ago, we came together to pass the no child left behind act, and today no one can deny its results. last year, fourth and eighth graders achieved the highest math scores on record. reading scores are on the rise. african american and hispanic students posted all-time highs. (applause.) now we must work together to increase accountability, add flexibility for states and districts, reduce the number of high school dropouts, provide extra help for struggling schools.members of congress: the no child left behind act is a bipartisan achievement. it is succeeding. and we owe it to america\\'s children, their parents, and their teachers to strengthen this good law. (applause.)we must also do more to help children when their schools do not measure up. thanks to the d.c. opportunity scholarships you approved, more than 2,600 of the poorest children in our nation\\'s capital have found new hope at a faith-based or other non-public school. sadly, these schools are disappearing at an alarming rate in many of america\\'s inner cities. so i will convene a white house summit aimed at strengthening these lifelines of learning. and to open the doors of these schools to more children, i ask you to support a new $300 million program called pell grants for kids. we have seen how pell grants help low-income college students realize their full potential. together, we\\'ve expanded the size and reach of these grants. now let us apply that same spirit to help liberate poor children trapped in failing public schools. (applause.)on trade, we must trust american workers to compete with anyone in the world and empower them by opening up new markets overseas. today, our economic growth increasingly depends on our ability to sell american goods and crops and services all over the world. so we\\'re working to break down barriers to trade and investment wherever we can. we\\'re working for a successful doha round of trade talks, and we must complete a good agreement this year. at the same time, we\\'re pursuing opportunities to open up new markets by passing free trade agreements.i thank the congress for approving a good agreement with peru. and now i ask you to approve agreements with colombia and panama and south korea. (applause.) many products from these nations now enter america duty-free, yet many of our products face steep tariffs in their markets. these agreements will level the playing field. they will give us better access to nearly 100 million customers. they will support good jobs for the finest workers in the world: those whose products say \"made in the usa.\" (applause.)these agreements also promote america\\'s strategic interests. the first agreement that will come before you is with colombia, a friend of america that is confronting violence and terror, and fighting drug traffickers. if we fail to pass this agreement, we will embolden the purveyors of false populism in our hemisphere. so we must come together, pass this agreement, and show our neighbors in the region that democracy leads to a better life. (applause.)trade brings better jobs and better choices and better prices. yet for some americans, trade can mean losing a job, and the federal government has a responsibility to help. (applause.) i ask congress to reauthorize and reform trade adjustment assistance, so we can help these displaced workers learn new skills and find new jobs. (applause.)to build a future of energy security, we must trust in the creative genius of american researchers and entrepreneurs and empower them to pioneer a new generation of clean energy technology. (applause.) our security, our prosperity, and our environment all require reducing our dependence on oil. last year, i asked you to pass legislation to reduce oil consumption over the next decade, and you responded. together we should take the next steps: let us fund new technologies that can generate coal power while capturing carbon emissions. (applause.) let us increase the use of renewable power and emissions-free nuclear power. (applause.) let us continue investing in advanced battery technology and renewable fuels to power the cars and trucks of the future. (applause.) let us create a new international clean technology fund, which will help developing nations like india and china make greater use of clean energy sources. and let us complete an international agreement that has the potential to slow, stop, and eventually reverse the growth of greenhouse gases. (applause.)this agreement will be effective only if it includes commitments by every major economy and gives none a free ride. (applause.) the united states is committed to strengthening our energy security and confronting global climate change. and the best way to meet these goals is for america to continue leading the way toward the development of cleaner and more energy-efficient technology. (applause.)to keep america competitive into the future, we must trust in the skill of our scientists and engineers and empower them to pursue the breakthroughs of tomorrow. last year, congress passed legislation supporting the american competitiveness initiative, but never followed through with the funding. this funding is essential to keeping our scientific edge. so i ask congress to double federal support for critical basic research in the physical sciences and ensure america remains the most dynamic nation on earth. (applause.)on matters of life and science, we must trust in the innovative spirit of medical researchers and empower them to discover new treatments while respecting moral boundaries. in november, we witnessed a landmark achievement when scientists discovered a way to reprogram adult skin cells to act like embryonic stem cells. this breakthrough has the potential to move us beyond the divisive debates of the past by extending the frontiers of medicine without the destruction of human life. (applause.)so we\\'re expanding funding for this type of ethical medical research. and as we explore promising avenues of research, we must also ensure that all life is treated with the dignity it deserves. and so i call on congress to pass legislation that bans unethical practices such as the buying, selling, patenting, or cloning of human life. (applause.)on matters of justice, we must trust in the wisdom of our founders and empower judges who understand that the constitution means what it says. (applause.) i\\'ve submitted judicial nominees who will rule by the letter of the law, not the whim of the gavel. many of these nominees are being unfairly delayed. they are worthy of confirmation, and the senate should give each of them a prompt up-or-down vote. (applause.)in communities across our land, we must trust in the good heart of the american people and empower them to serve their neighbors in need. over the past seven years, more of our fellow citizens have discovered that the pursuit of happiness leads to the path of service. americans have volunteered in record numbers. charitable donations are higher than ever. faith-based groups are bringing hope to pockets of despair, with newfound support from the federal government. and to help guarantee equal treatment of faith-based organizations when they compete for federal funds, i ask you to permanently extend charitable choice. (applause.)tonight the armies of compassion continue the march to a new day in the gulf coast. america honors the strength and resilience of the people of this region. we reaffirm our pledge to help them build stronger and better than before. and tonight i\\'m pleased to announce that in april we will host this year\\'s north american summit of canada, mexico, and the united states in the great city of new orleans. (applause.)there are two other pressing challenges that i\\'ve raised repeatedly before this body, and that this body has failed to address: entitlement spending and immigration. every member in this chamber knows that spending on entitlement programs like social security, medicare, and medicaid is growing faster than we can afford. we all know the painful choices ahead if america stays on this path: massive tax increases, sudden and drastic cuts in benefits, or crippling deficits. i\\'ve laid out proposals to reform these programs. now i ask members of congress to offer your proposals and come up with a bipartisan solution to save these vital programs for our children and our grandchildren. (applause.)the other pressing challenge is immigration. america needs to secure our borders — and with your help, my administration is taking steps to do so. we\\'re increasing worksite enforcement, deploying fences and advanced technologies to stop illegal crossings. we\\'ve effectively ended the policy of \"catch and release\" at the border, and by the end of this year, we will have doubled the number of border patrol agents. yet we also need to acknowledge that we will never fully secure our border until we create a lawful way for foreign workers to come here and support our economy. (applause.) this will take pressure off the border and allow law enforcement to concentrate on those who mean us harm. we must also find a sensible and humane way to deal with people here illegally. illegal immigration is complicated, but it can be resolved. and it must be resolved in a way that upholds both our laws and our highest ideals. (applause.)this is the business of our nation here at home. yet building a prosperous future for our citizens also depends on confronting enemies abroad and advancing liberty in troubled regions of the world.our foreign policy is based on a clear premise: we trust that people, when given the chance, will choose a future of freedom and peace. in the last seven years, we have witnessed stirring moments in the history of liberty. we\\'ve seen citizens in georgia and ukraine stand up for their right to free and fair elections. we\\'ve seen people in lebanon take to the streets to demand their independence. we\\'ve seen afghans emerge from the tyranny of the taliban and choose a new president and a new parliament. we\\'ve seen jubilant iraqis holding up ink-stained fingers and celebrating their freedom. these images of liberty have inspired us. (applause.)in the past seven years, we\\'ve also seen images that have sobered us. we\\'ve watched throngs of mourners in lebanon and pakistan carrying the caskets of beloved leaders taken by the assassin\\'s hand. we\\'ve seen wedding guests in blood-soaked finery staggering from a hotel in jordan, afghans and iraqis blown up in mosques and markets, and trains in london and madrid ripped apart by bombs. on a clear september day, we saw thousands of our fellow citizens taken from us in an instant. these horrific images serve as a grim reminder: the advance of liberty is opposed by terrorists and extremists — evil men who despise freedom, despise america, and aim to subject millions to their violent rule.since 9/11, we have taken the fight to these terrorists and extremists. we will stay on the offense, we will keep up the pressure, and we will deliver justice to our enemies. (applause.)we are engaged in the defining ideological struggle of the 21st century. the terrorists oppose every principle of humanity and decency that we hold dear. yet in this war on terror, there is one thing we and our enemies agree on: in the long run, men and women who are free to determine their own destinies will reject terror and refuse to live in tyranny. and that is why the terrorists are fighting to deny this choice to the people in lebanon, iraq, afghanistan, pakistan, and the palestinian territories. and that is why, for the security of america and the peace of the world, we are spreading the hope of freedom. (applause.)in afghanistan, america, our 25 nato allies, and 15 partner nations are helping the afghan people defend their freedom and rebuild their country. thanks to the courage of these military and civilian personnel, a nation that was once a safe haven for al qaeda is now a young democracy where boys and girls are going to school, new roads and hospitals are being built, and people are looking to the future with new hope. these successes must continue, so we\\'re adding 3,200 marines to our forces in afghanistan, where they will fight the terrorists and train the afghan army and police. defeating the taliban and al qaeda is critical to our security, and i thank the congress for supporting america\\'s vital mission in afghanistan. (applause.)in iraq, the terrorists and extremists are fighting to deny a proud people their liberty, and fighting to establish safe havens for attacks across the world. one year ago, our enemies were succeeding in their efforts to plunge iraq into chaos. so we reviewed our strategy and changed course. we launched a surge of american forces into iraq. we gave our troops a new mission: work with the iraqi forces to protect the iraqi people, pursue the enemy in its strongholds, and deny the terrorists sanctuary anywhere in the country.the iraqi people quickly realized that something dramatic had happened. those who had worried that america was preparing to abandon them instead saw tens of thousands of american forces flowing into their country. they saw our forces moving into neighborhoods, clearing out the terrorists, and staying behind to ensure the enemy did not return. and they saw our troops, along with provincial reconstruction teams that include foreign service officers and other skilled public servants, coming in to ensure that improved security was followed by improvements in daily life. our military and civilians in iraq are performing with courage and distinction, and they have the gratitude of our whole nation. (applause.)the iraqis launched a surge of their own. in the fall of 2006, sunni tribal leaders grew tired of al qaeda\\'s brutality and started a popular uprising called \"the anbar awakening.\" over the past year, similar movements have spread across the country. and today, the grassroots surge includes more than 80,000 iraqi citizens who are fighting the terrorists. the government in baghdad has stepped forward, as well — adding more than 100,000 new iraqi soldiers and police during the past year.while the enemy is still dangerous and more work remains, the american and iraqi surges have achieved results few of us could have imagined just one year ago. (applause.) when we met last year, many said that containing the violence was impossible. a year later, high profile terrorist attacks are down, civilian deaths are down, sectarian killings are down.when we met last year, militia extremists — some armed and trained by iran — were wreaking havoc in large areas of iraq. a year later, coalition and iraqi forces have killed or captured hundreds of militia fighters. and iraqis of all backgrounds increasingly realize that defeating these militia fighters is critical to the future of their country.when we met last year, al qaeda had sanctuaries in many areas of iraq, and their leaders had just offered american forces safe passage out of the country. today, it is al qaeda that is searching for safe passage. they have been driven from many of the strongholds they once held, and over the past year, we\\'ve captured or killed thousands of extremists in iraq, including hundreds of key al qaeda leaders and operatives.last month, osama bin laden released a tape in which he railed against iraqi tribal leaders who have turned on al qaeda and admitted that coalition forces are growing stronger in iraq. ladies and gentlemen, some may deny the surge is working, but among the terrorists there is no doubt. al qaeda is on the run in iraq, and this enemy will be defeated. (applause.)when we met last year, our troop levels in iraq were on the rise. today, because of the progress just described, we are implementing a policy of \"return on success,\" and the surge forces we sent to iraq are beginning to come home.this progress is a credit to the valor of our troops and the brilliance of their commanders. this evening, i want to speak directly to our men and women on the front lines. soldiers and sailors, airmen, marines, and coast guardsmen: in the past year, you have done everything we\\'ve asked of you, and more. our nation is grateful for your courage. we are proud of your accomplishments. and tonight in this hallowed chamber, with the american people as our witness, we make you a solemn pledge: in the fight ahead, you will have all you need to protect our nation. (applause.) and i ask congress to meet its responsibilities to these brave men and women by fully funding our troops. (applause.)our enemies in iraq have been hit hard. they are not yet defeated, and we can still expect tough fighting ahead. our objective in the coming year is to sustain and build on the gains we made in 2007, while transitioning to the next phase of our strategy. american troops are shifting from leading operations, to partnering with iraqi forces, and, eventually, to a protective overwatch mission. as part of this transition, one army brigade combat team and one marine expeditionary unit have already come home and will not be replaced. in the coming months, four additional brigades and two marine battalions will follow suit. taken together, this means more than 20,000 of our troops are coming home. (applause.)any further drawdown of u.s. troops will be based on conditions in iraq and the recommendations of our commanders. general petraeus has warned that too fast a drawdown could result in the \"disintegration of the iraqi security forces, al qaeda-iraq regaining lost ground, [and] a marked increase in violence.\" members of congress: having come so far and achieved so much, we must not allow this to happen. (applause.)in the coming year, we will work with iraqi leaders as they build on the progress they\\'re making toward political reconciliation. at the local level, sunnis, shia, and kurds are beginning to come together to reclaim their communities and rebuild their lives. progress in the provinces must be matched by progress in baghdad. (applause.) we\\'re seeing some encouraging signs. the national government is sharing oil revenues with the provinces. the parliament recently passed both a pension law and de-baathification reform. they\\'re now debating a provincial powers law. the iraqis still have a distance to travel. but after decades of dictatorship and the pain of sectarian violence, reconciliation is taking place — and the iraqi people are taking control of their future. (applause.)the mission in iraq has been difficult and trying for our nation. but it is in the vital interest of the united states that we succeed. a free iraq will deny al qaeda a safe haven. a free iraq will show millions across the middle east that a future of liberty is possible. a free iraq will be a friend of america, a partner in fighting terror, and a source of stability in a dangerous part of the world.by contrast, a failed iraq would embolden the extremists, strengthen iran, and give terrorists a base from which to launch new attacks on our friends, our allies, and our homeland. the enemy has made its intentions clear. at a time when the momentum seemed to favor them, al qaida\\'s top commander in iraq declared that they will not rest until they have attacked us here in washington. my fellow americans: we will not rest either. we will not rest until this enemy has been defeated. (applause.) we must do the difficult work today, so that years from now people will look back and say that this generation rose to the moment, prevailed in a tough fight, and left behind a more hopeful region and a safer america. (applause.)we\\'re also standing against the forces of extremism in the holy land, where we have new cause for hope. palestinians have elected a president who recognizes that confronting terror is essential to achieving a state where his people can live in dignity and at peace with israel. israelis have leaders who recognize that a peaceful, democratic palestinian state will be a source of lasting security. this month in ramallah and jerusalem, i assured leaders from both sides that america will do, and i will do, everything we can to help them achieve a peace agreement that defines a palestinian state by the end of this year. the time has come for a holy land where a democratic israel and a democratic palestine live side-by-side in peace. (applause.)we\\'re also standing against the forces of extremism embodied by the regime in tehran. iran\\'s rulers oppress a good and talented people. and wherever freedom advances in the middle east, it seems the iranian regime is there to oppose it. iran is funding and training militia groups in iraq, supporting hezbollah terrorists in lebanon, and backing hamas\\' efforts to undermine peace in the holy land. tehran is also developing ballistic missiles of increasing range, and continues to develop its capability to enrich uranium, which could be used to create a nuclear weapon.our message to the people of iran is clear: we have no quarrel with you. we respect your traditions and your history. we look forward to the day when you have your freedom. our message to the leaders of iran is also clear: verifiably suspend your nuclear enrichment, so negotiations can begin. and to rejoin the community of nations, come clean about your nuclear intentions and past actions, stop your oppression at home, cease your support for terror abroad. but above all, know this: america will confront those who threaten our troops. we will stand by our allies, and we will defend our vital interests in the persian gulf. (applause.)on the home front, we will continue to take every lawful and effective measure to protect our country. this is our most solemn duty. we are grateful that there has not been another attack on our soil since 9/11. this is not for the lack of desire or effort on the part of the enemy. in the past six years, we\\'ve stopped numerous attacks, including a plot to fly a plane into the tallest building in los angeles and another to blow up passenger jets bound for america over the atlantic. dedicated men and women in our government toil day and night to stop the terrorists from carrying out their plans. these good citizens are saving american lives, and everyone in this chamber owes them our thanks. (applause.)and we owe them something more: we owe them the tools they need to keep our people safe. and one of the most important tools we can give them is the ability to monitor terrorist communications. to protect america, we need to know who the terrorists are talking to, what they are saying, and what they\\'re planning. last year, congress passed legislation to help us do that. unfortunately, congress set the legislation to expire on february the 1st. that means if you don\\'t act by friday, our ability to track terrorist threats would be weakened and our citizens will be in greater danger. congress must ensure the flow of vital intelligence is not disrupted. congress must pass liability protection for companies believed to have assisted in the efforts to defend america. we\\'ve had ample time for debate. the time to act is now. (applause.)protecting our nation from the dangers of a new century requires more than good intelligence and a strong military. it also requires changing the conditions that breed resentment and allow extremists to prey on despair. so america is using its influence to build a freer, more hopeful, and more compassionate world. this is a reflection of our national interest; it is the calling of our conscience.america opposes genocide in sudan. (applause.) we support freedom in countries from cuba and zimbabwe to belarus and burma. (applause.)america is leading the fight against global poverty, with strong education initiatives and humanitarian assistance. we\\'ve also changed the way we deliver aid by launching the millennium challenge account. this program strengthens democracy, transparency, and the rule of law in developing nations, and i ask you to fully fund this important initiative. (applause.)america is leading the fight against global hunger. today, more than half the world\\'s food aid comes from the united states. and tonight, i ask congress to support an innovative proposal to provide food assistance by purchasing crops directly from farmers in the developing world, so we can build up local agriculture and help break the cycle of famine. (applause.)america is leading the fight against disease. with your help, we\\'re working to cut by half the number of malaria-related deaths in 15 african nations. and our emergency plan for aids relief is treating 1.4 million people. we can bring healing and hope to many more. so i ask you to maintain the principles that have changed behavior and made this program a success. and i call on you to double our initial commitment to fighting hiv/aids by approving an additional $30 billion over the next five years. (applause.)america is a force for hope in the world because we are a compassionate people, and some of the most compassionate americans are those who have stepped forward to protect us. we must keep faith with all who have risked life and limb so that we might live in freedom and peace. over the past seven years, we\\'ve increased funding for veterans by more than 95 percent. and as we increase funding — (applause.) and as increase funding we must also reform our veterans system to meet the needs of a new war and a new generation. (applause.) i call on the congress to enact the reforms recommended by senator bob dole and secretary donna shalala, so we can improve the system of care for our wounded warriors and help them build lives of hope and promise and dignity. (applause.)our military families also sacrifice for america. they endure sleepless nights and the daily struggle of providing for children while a loved one is serving far from home. we have a responsibility to provide for them. so i ask you to join me in expanding their access to child care, creating new hiring preferences for military spouses across the federal government, and allowing our troops to transfer their unused education benefits to their spouses or children. (applause.) our military families serve our nation, they inspire our nation, and tonight our nation honors them. (applause.)the strength — the secret of our strength, the miracle of america, is that our greatness lies not in our government, but in the spirit and determination of our people. (applause.) when the federal convention met in philadelphia in 1787, our nation was bound by the articles of confederation, which began with the words, \"we the undersigned delegates.\" when gouverneur morris was asked to draft a preamble to our new constitution, he offered an important revision and opened with words that changed the course of our nation and the history of the world: \"we the people.\"by trusting the people, our founders wagered that a great and noble nation could be built on the liberty that resides in the hearts of all men and women. by trusting the people, succeeding generations transformed our fragile young democracy into the most powerful nation on earth and a beacon of hope for millions. and so long as we continue to trust the people, our nation will prosper, our liberty will be secure, and the state of our union will remain strong. (applause.)so tonight, with confidence in freedom\\'s power, and trust in the people, let us set forth to do their business. god bless america. (applause.)'\n",
      " 'madame speaker, mr. vice president, members of congress, and the first lady of the united states: i\\'ve come here tonight not only to address the distinguished men and women in this great chamber, but to speak frankly and directly to the men and women who sent us here. i know that for many americans watching right now, the state of our economy is a concern that rises above all others. and rightly so. if you haven\\'t been personally affected by this recession, you probably know someone who has - a friend; a neighbor; a member of your family. you don\\'t need to hear another list of statistics to know that our economy is in crisis, because you live it every day. it\\'s the worry you wake up with and the source of sleepless nights. it\\'s the job you thought you\\'d retire from but now have lost; the business you built your dreams upon that\\'s now hanging by a thread; the college acceptance letter your child had to put back in the envelope. the impact of this recession is real, and it is everywhere. but while our economy may be weakened and our confidence shaken; though we are living through difficult and uncertain times, tonight i want every american to know this:we will rebuild, we will recover, and the united states of america willemerge stronger than before. the weight of this crisis will not determine the destiny of this nation. the answers to our problems don\\'t lie beyond our reach. they exist in our laboratories and universities; in our fields and our factories; in the imaginations of our entrepreneurs and the pride of the hardest-working people on earth. those qualities that have made america the greatest force of progress and prosperity in human history we still possess in ample measure. what is required now is for this country to pull together, confront boldly the challenges we face, and takeresponsibility for our future once more.now, if we\\'re honest with ourselves, we\\'ll admit that for too long, we have not always met these responsibilities — as a government or as a people. i say this not to lay blame or look backwards, but because it is only by understanding how we arrived at this moment that we\\'ll be able to lift ourselves out of this predicament. the fact is, our economy did not fall into decline overnight. nor did all of our problems begin when the housing market collapsed or the stock market sank. we have known for decades that our survival depends on finding new sources of energy. yet we import more oil today than ever before. the cost of health care eats up more and more of our savings each year, yet we keep delaying reform. our children will compete for jobs in a global economy that too many of our schools do not prepare them for. and though all these challenges went unsolved, we still managed to spend more money and pile up more debt, both as individuals and through our government, than ever before. in other words, we have lived through an era where too often, short-term gains were prized over long-term prosperity; where we failed to look beyond the next payment, the next quarter, or the next election. a surplus became an excuse to transfer wealth to the wealthy instead of an opportunity to invest in our future. regulations were gutted for the sake of a quick profit at the expense of a healthy market. people bought homes they knew they couldn\\'t afford from banks and lenders who pushed those bad loans anyway. and all the while, critical debates and difficult decisions were put off for some other time on some other day.well that day of reckoning has arrived, and the time to take charge of our future is here. now is the time to act boldly and wisely — to not only revive this economy, but to build a new foundation for lasting prosperity. now is the time to jumpstart job creation, re-start lending, and invest in areas like energy, health care, and education that will grow our economy, even as we make hard choices to bring our deficit down. that is what my economic agenda is designed to do, and that\\'s what i\\'d like to talk to you about tonight. it\\'s an agenda that begins with jobs. as soon as i took office, i asked this congress to send me a recovery plan by president\\'s day that would put people back to work and put money in their pockets. not because i believe in bigger government — i don\\'t. not because i\\'m not mindful of the massive debt we\\'ve inherited — i am. i called for action because the failure to do so would have cost more jobs and caused more hardships. in fact, a failure to act would have worsened our long-term deficit by assuring weak economic growth for years. that\\'s why i pushed for quick action. and tonight, i am grateful that this congress delivered, and pleased to say that the american recovery and reinvestment act is now law. over the next two years, this plan will save or create 3.5 million jobs.more than 90% of these jobs will be in the private sector — jobs rebuilding our roads and bridges; constructing wind turbines and solar panels; laying broadband and expanding mass transit.because of this plan, there are teachers who can now keep their jobs and educate our kids. health care professionals can continue caring for our sick. there are 57 police officers who are still on the streets of minneapolis tonight because this plan prevented the layoffs their department was about to make. because of this plan, 95% of the working households in america will receive a tax cut — a tax cut that you will see in your paychecks beginning on april 1st. because of this plan, families who are struggling to pay tuition costs will receive a $2,500 tax credit for all four years of college. and americans who have lost their jobs in this recession will be able to receive extended unemployment benefits and continued health care coverage to help them weather this storm. i know there are some in this chamber and watching at home who are skeptical of whether this plan will work. i understand that skepticism. here in washington, we\\'ve all seen how quickly good intentions can turn into broken promises and wasteful spending. and with a plan of this scale comes enormous responsibility to get it right. that is why i have asked vice president biden to lead a tough, unprecedented oversight effort — because nobody messes with joe. i have told each member of my cabinet as well as mayors and governors across the country that they will be held accountable by me and the american people for every dollar they spend. i have appointed a proven and aggressive inspector general to ferret out any and all cases of waste and fraud. and we have created a new website called recovery.gov so that every american can find out how and where their money is being spent. so the recovery plan we passed is the first step in getting our economy back on track. but it is just the first step. because even if we manage this plan flawlessly, there will be no real recovery unless we clean up the credit crisis that has severely weakened our financial system.i want to speak plainly and candidly about this issue tonight, because every american should know that it directly affects you and your family\\'s well-being. you should also know that the money you\\'ve deposited in banks across the country is safe; your insurance is secure; and you can rely on the continued operation of our financial system. that is not the source of concern.the concern is that if we do not re-start lending in this country, our recovery will be choked off before it even begins. you see, the flow of credit is the lifeblood of our economy. the ability to get a loan is how you finance the purchase of everything from a home to a car to a college education; how stores stock their shelves, farms buy equipment, and businesses make payroll. but credit has stopped flowing the way it should. too many bad loans from the housing crisis have made their way onto the books of too many banks. with so much debt and so little confidence, these banks are now fearful of lending out any more money to households, to businesses, or to each other. when there is no lending, families can\\'t afford to buy homes or cars. so businesses are forced to make layoffs. our economy suffers even more, and credit dries up even further. that is why this administration is moving swiftly and aggressively to break this destructive cycle, restore confidence, and re-start lending.we will do so in several ways. first, we are creating a new lending fund that represents the largest effort ever to help provide auto loans, college loans, and small business loans to the consumers and entrepreneurs who keep this economy running. second, we have launched a housing plan that will help responsible families facing the threat of foreclosure lower their monthly payments and re-finance their mortgages. it\\'s a plan that won\\'t help speculators or that neighbor down the street who bought a house he could never hope to afford, but it will help millions of americans who are struggling with declining home values - americans who will now be able to take advantage of the lower interest rates that this plan has already helped bring about. in fact, the average family who re-finances today can save nearly $2000 per year on their mortgage. third, we will act with the full force of the federal government to ensure that the major banks that americans depend on have enough confidence and enough money to lend even in more difficult times. and when we learn that a major bank has serious problems, we will hold accountable those responsible, force the necessary adjustments, provide the support to clean up their balance sheets, and assure the continuity of a strong, viable institution that can serve our people and our economy. i understand that on any given day, wall street may be more comforted by an approach that gives banks bailouts with no strings attached, and that holds nobody accountable for their reckless decisions. but such an approach won\\'t solve the problem. and our goal is to quicken the day when we re-start lending to the american people and american business and end this crisis once and for all.i intend to hold these banks fully accountable for the assistance they receive, and this time, they will have to clearly demonstrate how taxpayer dollars result in more lending for the american taxpayer. this time, ceos won\\'t be able to use taxpayer money to pad their paychecks or buy fancy drapes or disappear on a private jet. those days are over. still, this plan will require significant resources from the federal government — and yes, probably more than we\\'ve already set aside. but while the cost of action will be great, i can assure you that the cost of inaction will be far greater, for it could result in an economy that sputters along for not months or years, but perhaps a decade. that would be worse for our deficit, worse for business, worse for you, and worse for the next generation. and i refuse to let that happen. i understand that when the last administration asked this congress to provide assistance for struggling banks, democrats and republicans alike were infuriated by the mismanagement and results that followed. so were the american taxpayers. so was i. so i know how unpopular it is to be seen as helping banks right now, especially when everyone is suffering in part from their bad decisions. i promise you - i get it. but i also know that in a time of crisis, we cannot afford to govern out of anger, or yield to the politics of the moment. my job — our job — is to solve the problem. our job is to govern with a sense of responsibility. i will not spend a single penny for the purpose of rewarding a single wall street executive, but i will do whatever it takes to help the small business that can\\'t pay its workers or the family that has saved and still can\\'t get a mortgage. that\\'s what this is about. it\\'s not about helping banks — it\\'s about helping people. because when credit is available again, that young family can finally buy a new home. and then some company will hire workers to build it. and then those workers will have money to spend, and if they can get a loan too, maybe they\\'ll finally buy that car, or open their own business. investors will return to the market, and american families will see their retirement secured once more. slowly, but surely, confidence will return, and our economy will recover. so i ask this congress to join me in doing whatever proves necessary. because we cannot consign our nation to an open-ended recession. and to ensure that a crisis of this magnitude never happens again, i ask congress to move quickly on legislation that will finally reform our outdated regulatory system. it is time to put in place tough, new common-sense rules of the road so that our financial market rewards drive and innovation, and punishes short-cuts and abuse. the recovery plan and the financial stability plan are the immediate steps we\\'re taking to revive our economy in the short-term. but the only way to fully restore america\\'s economic strength is to make the long-term investments that will lead to new jobs, new industries, and a renewed ability to compete with the rest of the world. the only way this century will be another american century is if we confront at last the price of our dependence on oil and the high cost of health care; the schools that aren\\'t preparing our children and the mountain of debt they stand to inherit. that is our responsibility. in the next few days, i will submit a budget to congress. so often, we have come to view these documents as simply numbers on a page or laundry lists of programs. i see this document differently. i see it as a vision for america — as a blueprint for our future.my budget does not attempt to solve every problem or address every issue. it reflects the stark reality of what we\\'ve inherited — a trillion dollar deficit, a financial crisis, and a costly recession. given these realities, everyone in this chamber - democrats and republicans — will have to sacrifice some worthy priorities for which there are no dollars. and that includes me. but that does not mean we can afford to ignore our long-term challenges. i reject the view that says our problems will simply take care of themselves; that says government has no role in laying the foundation for our common prosperity.for history tells a different story. history reminds us that at every moment of economic upheaval and transformation, this nation has responded with bold action and big ideas. in the midst of civil war, we laid railroad tracks from one coast to another that spurred commerce and industry. from the turmoil of the industrial revolution came a system of public high schools that prepared our citizens for a new age. in the wake of war and depression, the gi bill sent a generation to college and created the largest middle-class in history. and a twilight struggle for freedom led to a nation of highways, an american on the moon, and an explosion of technology that still shapes our world. in each case, government didn\\'t supplant private enterprise; it catalyzed private enterprise. it created the conditions for thousands of entrepreneurs and new businesses to adapt and to thrive. we are a nation that has seen promise amid peril, and claimed opportunity from ordeal. now we must be that nation again. that is why, even as it cuts back on the programs we don\\'t need, the budget i submit will invest in the three areas that are absolutely critical to our economic future: energy, health care, and education. it begins with energy. we know the country that harnesses the power of clean, renewable energy will lead the 21st century. and yet, it is china that has launched the largest effort in history to make their economy energy efficient. we invented solar technology, but we\\'ve fallen behind countries like germany and japan in producing it. new plug-in hybrids roll off our assembly lines, but they will run on batteries made in korea. well i do not accept a future where the jobs and industries of tomorrow take root beyond our borders - and i know you don\\'t either. it is time for america to lead again. thanks to our recovery plan, we will double this nation\\'s supply of renewable energy in the next three years. we have also made the largest investment in basic research funding in american history - an investment that will spur not only new discoveries in energy, but breakthroughs in medicine, science, and technology. we will soon lay down thousands of miles of power lines that can carry new energy to cities and towns across this country. and we will put americans to work making our homes and buildings more efficient so that we can save billions of dollars on our energy bills. but to truly transform our economy, protect our security, and save our planet from the ravages of climate change, we need to ultimately make clean, renewable energy the profitable kind of energy. so i ask this congress to send me legislation that places a market-based cap on carbon pollution and drives the production of more renewable energy in america. and to support that innovation, we will invest fifteen billion dollars a year to develop technologies like wind power and solar power; advanced biofuels, clean coal, and more fuel-efficient cars and trucks built right here in america. as for our auto industry, everyone recognizes that years of bad decision-making and a global recession have pushed our automakers to the brink. we should not, and will not, protect them from their own bad practices. but we are committed to the goal of a re-tooled, re-imagined auto industry that can compete and win. millions of jobs depend on it. scores of communities depend on it. and i believe the nation that invented the automobile cannot walk away from it. none of this will come without cost, nor will it be easy. but this is america. we don\\'t do what\\'s easy. we do what is necessary to move this country forward. for that same reason, we must also address the crushing cost of health care. this is a cost that now causes a bankruptcy in america every thirty seconds. by the end of the year, it could cause 1.5 million americans to lose their homes. in the last eight years, premiums have grown four times faster than wages. and in each of these years, one million more americans have lost their health insurance. it is one of the major reasons why small businesses close their doors and corporations ship jobs overseas. and it\\'s one of the largest and fastest-growing parts of our budget. given these facts, we can no longer afford to put health care reform on hold. already, we have done more to advance the cause of health care reform in the last thirty days than we have in the last decade. when it was days old, this congress passed a law to provide and protect health insurance for eleven million american children whose parents work full-time. our recovery plan will invest in electronic health records and new technology that will reduce errors, bring down costs, ensure privacy, and save lives. it will launch a new effort to conquer a disease that has touched the life of nearly every american by seeking a cure for cancer in our time. and it makes the largest investment ever in preventive care, because that is one of the best ways to keep our people healthy and our costs under control. this budget builds on these reforms. it includes an historic commitment to comprehensive health care reform — a down-payment on the principle that we must have quality, affordable health care for every american. it\\'s a commitment that\\'s paid for in part by efficiencies in our system that are long overdue. and it\\'s a step we must take if we hope to bring down our deficit in the years to come. now, there will be many different opinions and ideas about how to achieve reform, and that is why i\\'m bringing together businesses and workers, doctors and health care providers, democrats and republicans to begin work on this issue next week. i suffer no illusions that this will be an easy process. it will be hard. but i also know that nearly a century after teddy roosevelt first called for reform, the cost of our health care has weighed down our economy and the conscience of our nation long enough. so let there be no doubt: health care reform cannot wait, it must not wait, and it will not wait another year. the third challenge we must address is the urgent need to expand the promise of education in america. in a global economy where the most valuable skill you can sell is your knowledge, a good education is no longer just a pathway to opportunity — it is a pre-requisite. right now, three-quarters of the fastest-growing occupations require more than a high school diploma. and yet, just over half of our citizens have that level of education. we have one of the highest high school dropout rates of any industrialized nation. and half of the students who begin college never finish. this is a prescription for economic decline, because we know the countries that out-teach us today will out-compete us tomorrow. that is why it will be the goal of this administration to ensure that every child has access to a complete and competitive education — from the day they are born to the day they begin a career. already, we have made an historic investment in education through the economic recovery plan. we have dramatically expanded early childhood education and will continue to improve its quality, because we know that the most formative learning comes in those first years of life. we have made college affordable for nearly seven million more students. and we have provided the resources necessary to prevent painful cuts and teacher layoffs that would set back our children\\'s progress. but we know that our schools don\\'t just need more resources. they need more reform. that is why this budget creates new incentives for teacher performance; pathways for advancement, and rewards for success. we\\'ll invest in innovative programs that are already helping schools meet high standards and close achievement gaps. and we will expand our commitment to charter schools. it is our responsibility as lawmakers and educators to make this system work. but it is the responsibility of every citizen to participate in it. and so tonight, i ask every american to commit to at least one year or more of higher education or career training. this can be community college or a four-year school; vocational training or an apprenticeship. but whatever the training may be, every american will need to get more than a high school diploma. and dropping out of high school is no longer an option. it\\'s not just quitting on yourself, it\\'s quitting on your country — and this country needs and values the talents of every american. that is why we will provide the support necessary for you to complete college and meet a new goal: by 2020, america will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world. i know that the price of tuition is higher than ever, which is why if you are willing to volunteer in your neighborhood or give back to your community or serve your country, we will make sure that you can afford a higher education. and to encourage a renewed spirit of national service for this and future generations, i ask this congress to send me the bipartisan legislation that bears the name of senator orrin hatch as well as an american who has never stopped asking what he can do for his country — senator edward kennedy. these education policies will open the doors of opportunity for our children. but it is up to us to ensure they walk through them. in the end, there is no program or policy that can substitute for a mother or father who will attend those parent/teacher conferences, or help with homework after dinner, or turn off the tv, put away the video games, and read to their child. i speak to you not just as a president, but as a father when i say that responsibility for our children\\'s education must begin at home. there is, of course, another responsibility we have to our children. and that is the responsibility to ensure that we do not pass on to them a debt they cannot pay. with the deficit we inherited, the cost of the crisis we face, and the long-term challenges we must meet, it has never been more important to ensure that as our economy recovers, we do what it takes to bring this deficit down. i\\'m proud that we passed the recovery plan free of earmarks, and i want to pass a budget next year that ensures that each dollar we spend reflects only our most important national priorities. yesterday, i held a fiscal summit where i pledged to cut the deficit in half by the end of my first term in office. my administration has also begun to go line by line through the federal budget in order to eliminate wasteful and ineffective programs. as you can imagine, this is a process that will take some time. but we\\'re starting with the biggest lines. we have already identified two trillion dollars in savings over the next decade. in this budget, we will end education programs that don\\'t work and end direct payments to large agribusinesses that don\\'t need them. we\\'ll eliminate the no-bid contracts that have wasted billions in iraq, and reform our defense budget so that we\\'re not paying for cold war-era weapons systems we don\\'t use. we will root out the waste, fraud, and abuse in our medicare program that doesn\\'t make our seniors any healthier, and we will restore a sense of fairness and balance to our tax code by finally ending the tax breaks for corporations that ship our jobs overseas. in order to save our children from a future of debt, we will also end the tax breaks for the wealthiest 2% of americans. but let me perfectly clear, because i know you\\'ll hear the same old claims that rolling back these tax breaks means a massive tax increase on the american people: if your family earns less than $250,000 a year, you will not see your taxes increased a single dime. i repeat: not one single dime. in fact, the recovery plan provides a tax cut — that\\'s right, a tax cut — for 95% of working families. and these checks are on the way. to preserve our long-term fiscal health, we must also address the growing costs in medicare and social security. comprehensive health care reform is the best way to strengthen medicare for years to come. and we must also begin a conversation on how to do the same for social security, while creating tax-free universal savings accounts for all americans.finally, because we\\'re also suffering from a deficit of trust, i am committed to restoring a sense of honesty and accountability to our budget. that is why this budget looks ahead ten years and accounts for spending that was left out under the old rules - and for the first time, that includes the full cost of fighting in iraq and afghanistan. for seven years, we have been a nation at war. no longer will we hide its price.we are now carefully reviewing our policies in both wars, and i will soon announce a way forward in iraq that leaves iraq to its people and responsibly ends this war. and with our friends and allies, we will forge a new and comprehensive strategy for afghanistan and pakistan to defeat al qaeda and combat extremism. because i will not allow terrorists to plot against the american people from safe havens half a world away. as we meet here tonight, our men and women in uniform stand watch abroad and more are readying to deploy. to each and every one of them, and to the families who bear the quiet burden of their absence, americans are united in sending one message: we honor your service, we are inspired by your sacrifice, and you have our unyielding support. to relieve the strain on our forces, my budget increases the number of our soldiers and marines. and to keep our sacred trust with those who serve, we will raise their pay, and give our veterans the expanded health care and benefits that they have earned. to overcome extremism, we must also be vigilant in upholding the values our troops defend — because there is no force in the world more powerful than the example of america. that is why i have ordered the closing of the detention center at guantanamo bay, and will seek swift and certain justice for captured terrorists - because living our values doesn\\'t make us weaker, it makes us safer and it makes us stronger. and that is why i can stand here tonight and say without exception or equivocation that the united states of america does not torture. in words and deeds, we are showing the world that a new era of engagement has begun. for we know that america cannot meet the threats of this century alone, but the world cannot meet them without america. we cannot shun the negotiating table, nor ignore the foes or forces that could do us harm. we are instead called to move forward with the sense of confidence and candor that serious times demand. to seek progress toward a secure and lasting peace between israel and her neighbors, we have appointed an envoy to sustain our effort. to meet the challenges of the 21st century - from terrorism to nuclear proliferation; from pandemic disease to cyber threats to crushing poverty — we will strengthen old alliances, forge new ones, and use all elements of our national power. and to respond to an economic crisis that is global in scope, we are working with the nations of the g-20 to restore confidence in our financial system, avoid the possibility of escalating protectionism, and spur demand for american goods in markets across the globe. for the world depends on us to have a strong economy, just as our economy depends on the strength of the world\\'s. as we stand at this crossroads of history, the eyes of all people in all nations are once again upon us - watching to see what we do with this moment; waiting for us to lead. those of us gathered here tonight have been called to govern in extraordinary times. it is a tremendous burden, but also a great privilege - one that has been entrusted to few generations of americans. for in our hands lies the ability to shape our world for good or for ill. i know that it is easy to lose sight of this truth — to become cynical and doubtful; consumed with the petty and the trivial. but in my life, i have also learned that hope is found in unlikely places; that inspiration often comes not from those with the most power or celebrity, but from the dreams and aspirations of americans who are anything but ordinary. i think about leonard abess, the bank president from miami who reportedly cashed out of his company, took a $60 million bonus, and gave it out to all 399 people who worked for him, plus another 72 who used to work for him. he didn\\'t tell anyone, but when the local newspaper found out, he simply said, i knew some of these people since i was 7 years old. i didn\\'t feel right getting the money myself.\"i think about greensburg, kansas, a town that was completely destroyed by a tornado, but is being rebuilt by its residents as a global example of how clean energy can power an entire community - how it can bring jobs and businesses to a place where piles of bricks and rubble once lay. \"the tragedy was terrible,\" said one of the men who helped them rebuild. \"but the folks here know that it also provided an incredible opportunity.\" and i think about ty\\'sheoma bethea, the young girl from that school i visited in dillon, south carolina — a place where the ceilings leak, the paint peels off the walls, and they have to stop teaching six times a day because the train barrels by their classroom. she has been told that her school is hopeless, but the other day after class she went to the public library and typed up a letter to the people sitting in this room. she even asked her principal for the money to buy a stamp. the letter asks us for help, and says, \"we are just students trying to become lawyers, doctors, congressmen like yourself and one day president, so we can make a change to not just the state of south carolina but also the world. we are not quitters.\" we are not quitters. these words and these stories tell us something about the spirit of the people who sent us here. they tell us that even in the most trying times, amid the most difficult circumstances, there is a generosity, a resilience, a decency, and a determination that perseveres; a willingness to take responsibility for our future and for posterity. their resolve must be our inspiration. their concerns must be our cause. and we must show them and all our people that we are equal to the task before us. i know that we haven\\'t agreed on every issue thus far, and there are surely times in the future when we will part ways. but i also know that every american who is sitting here tonight loves this country and wants it to succeed. that must be the starting point for every debate we have in the coming months, and where we return after those debates are done. that is the foundation on which the american people expect us to build common ground. and if we do — if we come together and lift this nation from the depths of this crisis; if we put our people back to work and restart the engine of our prosperity; if we confront without fear the challenges of our time and summon that enduring spirit of an america that does not quit, then someday years from now our children can tell their children that this was the time when we performed, in the words that are carved into this very chamber, \"something worthy to be remembered.\"thank you, god bless you, and may god bless the united states of america.'\n",
      " 'madam speaker, vice president biden, members of congress, distinguished guests, and fellow americans:our constitution declares that from time to time, the president shall give to congress information about the state of our union.  for 220 years, our leaders have fulfilled this duty. they\\'ve done so during periods of prosperity and tranquility.  and they\\'ve done so in the midst of war and depression; at moments of great strife and great struggle.it\\'s tempting to look back on these moments and assume that our progress was inevitable -– that america was always destined to succeed.  but when the union was turned back at bull run, and the allies first landed at omaha beach, victory was very much in doubt.  when the market crashed on black tuesday, and civil rights marchers were beaten on bloody sunday, the future was anything but certain.  these were the times that tested the courage of our convictions, and the strength of our union.  and despite all our divisions and disagreements, our hesitations and our fears, america prevailed because we chose to move forward as one nation, as one people. again, we are tested.  and again, we must answer history\\'s call.one year ago, i took office amid two wars, an economy rocked by a severe recession, a financial system on the verge of collapse, and a government deeply in debt.  experts from across the political spectrum warned that if we did not act, we might face a second depression.  so we acted -– immediately and aggressively.  and one year later, the worst of the storm has passed.but the devastation remains.  one in 10 americans still cannot find work.  many businesses have shuttered.  home values have declined.  small towns and rural communities have been hit especially hard.  and for those who\\'d already known poverty, life has become that much harder.this recession has also compounded the burdens that america\\'s families have been dealing with for decades –- the burden of working harder and longer for less; of being unable to save enough to retire or help kids with college. so i know the anxieties that are out there right now.  they\\'re not new.  these struggles are the reason i ran for president.  these struggles are what i\\'ve witnessed for years in places like elkhart, indiana; galesburg, illinois.  i hear about them in the letters that i read each night.  the toughest to read are those written by children -– asking why they have to move from their home, asking when their mom or dad will be able to go back to work.for these americans and so many others, change has not come fast enough.  some are frustrated; some are angry.  they don\\'t understand why it seems like bad behavior on wall street is rewarded, but hard work on main street isn\\'t; or why washington has been unable or unwilling to solve any of our problems.  they\\'re tired of the partisanship and the shouting and the pettiness.  they know we can\\'t afford it.  not now.  so we face big and difficult challenges.  and what the american people hope -– what they deserve -– is for all of us, democrats and republicans, to work through our differences; to overcome the numbing weight of our politics.  for while the people who sent us here have different backgrounds, different stories, different beliefs, the anxieties they face are the same. the aspirations they hold are shared:  a job that pays the bills; a chance to get ahead; most of all, the ability to give their children a better life. you know what else they share?  they share a stubborn resilience in the face of adversity.  after one of the most difficult years in our history, they remain busy building cars and teaching kids, starting businesses and going back to school. they\\'re coaching little league and helping their neighbors.  one woman wrote to me and said, \"we are strained but hopeful, struggling but encouraged.\" it\\'s because of this spirit -– this great decency and great strength -– that i have never been more hopeful about america\\'s future than i am tonight.  (applause.)  despite our hardships, our union is strong.  we do not give up.  we do not quit.  we do not allow fear or division to break our spirit.  in this new decade, it\\'s time the american people get a government that matches their decency; that embodies their strength.  (applause.)   and tonight, tonight i\\'d like to talk about how together we can deliver on that promise.   it begins with our economy. our most urgent task upon taking office was to shore up the same banks that helped cause this crisis.  it was not easy to do. and if there\\'s one thing that has unified democrats and republicans, and everybody in between, it\\'s that we all hated the bank bailout.  i hated it -- (applause.)  i hated it.  you hated it.  it was about as popular as a root canal.  (laughter.)  but when i ran for president, i promised i wouldn\\'t just do what was popular -– i would do what was necessary.  and if we had allowed the meltdown of the financial system, unemployment might be double what it is today.  more businesses would certainly have closed.  more homes would have surely been lost. so i supported the last administration\\'s efforts to create the financial rescue program.  and when we took that program over, we made it more transparent and more accountable.  and as a result, the markets are now stabilized, and we\\'ve recovered most of the money we spent on the banks.  (applause.)  most but not all.to recover the rest, i\\'ve proposed a fee on the biggest banks.  (applause.)  now, i know wall street isn\\'t keen on this idea.  but if these firms can afford to hand out big bonuses again, they can afford a modest fee to pay back the taxpayers who rescued them in their time of need.  (applause.)now, as we stabilized the financial system, we also took steps to get our economy growing again, save as many jobs as possible, and help americans who had become unemployed. that\\'s why we extended or increased unemployment benefits for more than 18 million americans; made health insurance 65 percent cheaper for families who get their coverage through cobra; and passed 25 different tax cuts.now, let me repeat:  we cut taxes.  we cut taxes for 95 percent of working families.  (applause.)  we cut taxes for small businesses.  we cut taxes for first-time homebuyers.  we cut taxes for parents trying to care for their children.  we cut taxes for 8 million americans paying for college.  (applause.)i thought i\\'d get some applause on that one.  (laughter and applause.)as a result, millions of americans had more to spend on gas and food and other necessities, all of which helped businesses keep more workers.  and we haven\\'t raised income taxes by a single dime on a single person.  not a single dime.  (applause.)because of the steps we took, there are about two million americans working right now who would otherwise be unemployed.  (applause.)  two hundred thousand work in construction and clean energy; 300,000 are teachers and other education workers.  tens of thousands are cops, firefighters, correctional officers, first responders.  (applause.)  and we\\'re on track to add another one and a half million jobs to this total by the end of the year.the plan that has made all of this possible, from the tax cuts to the jobs, is the recovery act.  (applause.)  that\\'s right -– the recovery act, also known as the stimulus bill.  (applause.)  economists on the left and the right say this bill has helped save jobs and avert disaster.  but you don\\'t have to take their word for it.  talk to the small business in phoenix that will triple its workforce because of the recovery act.  talk to the window manufacturer in philadelphia who said he used to be skeptical about the recovery act, until he had to add two more work shifts just because of the business it created.  talk to the single teacher raising two kids who was told by her principal in the last week of school that because of the recovery act, she wouldn\\'t be laid off after all. there are stories like this all across america.  and after two years of recession, the economy is growing again.  retirement funds have started to gain back some of their value.  businesses are beginning to invest again, and slowly some are starting to hire again.   but i realize that for every success story, there are other stories, of men and women who wake up with the anguish of not knowing where their next paycheck will come from; who send out resumes week after week and hear nothing in response.  that is why jobs must be our number-one focus in 2010, and that\\'s why i\\'m calling for a new jobs bill tonight.  (applause.)  now, the true engine of job creation in this country will always be america\\'s businesses.  (applause.)  but government can create the conditions necessary for businesses to expand and hire more workers. we should start where most new jobs do –- in small businesses, companies that begin when -- (applause) -- companies that begin when an entrepreneur -- when an entrepreneur takes a chance on a dream, or a worker decides it\\'s time she became her own boss.  through sheer grit and determination, these companies have weathered the recession and they\\'re ready to grow.  but when you talk to small businessowners in places like allentown, pennsylvania, or elyria, ohio, you find out that even though banks on wall street are lending again, they\\'re mostly lending to bigger companies.  financing remains difficult for small businessowners across the country, even those that are making a profit.so tonight, i\\'m proposing that we take $30 billion of the money wall street banks have repaid and use it to help community banks give small businesses the credit they need to stay afloat. (applause.)  i\\'m also proposing a new small business tax credit-– one that will go to over one million small businesses who hire new workers or raise wages.  (applause.)  while we\\'re at it, let\\'s also eliminate all capital gains taxes on small business investment, and provide a tax incentive for all large businesses and all small businesses to invest in new plants and equipment.  (applause.) next, we can put americans to work today building the infrastructure of tomorrow.  (applause.)  from the first railroads to the interstate highway system, our nation has always been built to compete.  there\\'s no reason europe or china should have the fastest trains, or the new factories that manufacture clean energy products.tomorrow, i\\'ll visit tampa, florida, where workers will soon break ground on a new high-speed railroad funded by the recovery act.  (applause.)  there are projects like that all across this country that will create jobs and help move our nation\\'s goods, services, and information.  (applause.) we should put more americans to work building clean energy facilities -- (applause) -- and give rebates to americans who make their homes more energy-efficient, which supports clean energy jobs.  (applause.)  and to encourage these and other businesses to stay within our borders, it is time to finally slash the tax breaks for companies that ship our jobs overseas, and give those tax breaks to companies that create jobs right here in the united states of america.  (applause.)now, the house has passed a jobs bill that includes some of these steps.  (applause.)  as the first order of business this year, i urge the senate to do the same, and i know they will.  (applause.)  they will.  (applause.)  people are out of work.  they\\'re hurting.  they need our help.  and i want a jobs bill on my desk without delay.  (applause.)but the truth is, these steps won\\'t make up for the seven million jobs that we\\'ve lost over the last two years.  the only way to move to full employment is to lay a new foundation for long-term economic growth, and finally address the problems that america\\'s families have confronted for years.  we can\\'t afford another so-called economic \"expansion\" like the one from the last decade –- what some call the \"lost decade\" -– where jobs grew more slowly than during any prior expansion; where the income of the average american household declined while the cost of health care and tuition reached record highs; where prosperity was built on a housing bubble and financial speculation. from the day i took office, i\\'ve been told that addressing our larger challenges is too ambitious; such an effort would be too contentious.  i\\'ve been told that our political system is too gridlocked, and that we should just put things on hold for a while. for those who make these claims, i have one simple question: how long should we wait?  how long should america put its future on hold?  (applause.)you see, washington has been telling us to wait for decades, even as the problems have grown worse.  meanwhile, china is not waiting to revamp its economy.  germany is not waiting.  india is not waiting.  these nations -- they\\'re not standing still.  these nations aren\\'t playing for second place.  they\\'re putting more emphasis on math and science.  they\\'re rebuilding their infrastructure.  they\\'re making serious investments in clean energy because they want those jobs.  well, i do not accept second place for the united states of america.  (applause.) as hard as it may be, as uncomfortable and contentious as the debates may become, it\\'s time to get serious about fixing the problems that are hampering our growth.now, one place to start is serious financial reform.  look, i am not interested in punishing banks.  i\\'m interested in protecting our economy.  a strong, healthy financial market makes it possible for businesses to access credit and create new jobs. it channels the savings of families into investments that raise incomes.  but that can only happen if we guard against the same recklessness that nearly brought down our entire economy. we need to make sure consumers and middle-class families have the information they need to make financial decisions.  (applause.)  we can\\'t allow financial institutions, including those that take your deposits, to take risks that threaten the whole economy.  now, the house has already passed financial reform with many of these changes.  (applause.)  and the lobbyists are trying to kill it.  but we cannot let them win this fight.  (applause.)  and if the bill that ends up on my desk does not meet the test of real reform, i will send it back until we get it right.  we\\'ve got to get it right.  (applause.)next, we need to encourage american innovation.  last year, we made the largest investment in basic research funding in history -– (applause) -- an investment that could lead to the world\\'s cheapest solar cells or treatment that kills cancer cells but leaves healthy ones untouched.  and no area is more ripe for such innovation than energy.  you can see the results of last year\\'s investments in clean energy -– in the north carolina company that will create 1,200 jobs nationwide helping to make advanced batteries; or in the california business that will put a thousand people to work making solar panels.but to create more of these clean energy jobs, we need more production, more efficiency, more incentives.  and that means building a new generation of safe, clean nuclear power plants in this country.  (applause.)  it means making tough decisions about opening new offshore areas for oil and gas development.  (applause.)  it means continued investment in advanced biofuels and clean coal technologies.  (applause.)  and, yes, it means passing a comprehensive energy and climate bill with incentives that will finally make clean energy the profitable kind of energy in america.  (applause.)i am grateful to the house for passing such a bill last year.  (applause.)  and this year i\\'m eager to help advance the bipartisan effort in the senate.  (applause.) i know there have been questions about whether we can afford such changes in a tough economy.  i know that there are those who disagree with the overwhelming scientific evidence on climate change.  but here\\'s the thing -- even if you doubt the evidence, providing incentives for energy-efficiency and clean energy are the right thing to do for our future -– because the nation that leads the clean energy economy will be the nation that leads the global economy.  and america must be that nation.  (applause.)third, we need to export more of our goods.  (applause.)  because the more products we make and sell to other countries, the more jobs we support right here in america.  (applause.)  so tonight, we set a new goal:  we will double our exports over the next five years, an increase that will support two million jobs in america.  (applause.)  to help meet this goal, we\\'re launching a national export initiative that will help farmers and small businesses increase their exports, and reform export controls consistent with national security.  (applause.)we have to seek new markets aggressively, just as our competitors are.  if america sits on the sidelines while other nations sign trade deals, we will lose the chance to create jobs on our shores.  (applause.)  but realizing those benefits also means enforcing those agreements so our trading partners play by the rules.  (applause.)  and that\\'s why we\\'ll continue to shape a doha trade agreement that opens global markets, and why we will strengthen our trade relations in asia and with key partners like south korea and panama and colombia.  (applause.)fourth, we need to invest in the skills and education of our people.  (applause.)now, this year, we\\'ve broken through the stalemate between left and right by launching a national competition to improve our schools.  and the idea here is simple:  instead of rewarding failure, we only reward success.  instead of funding the status quo, we only invest in reform -- reform that raises student achievement; inspires students to excel in math and science; and turns around failing schools that steal the future of too many young americans, from rural communities to the inner city.  in the 21st century, the best anti-poverty program around is a world-class education.  (applause.)  and in this country, the success of our children cannot depend more on where they live than on their potential. when we renew the elementary and secondary education act, we will work with congress to expand these reforms to all 50 states.  still, in this economy, a high school diploma no longer guarantees a good job.  that\\'s why i urge the senate to follow the house and pass a bill that will revitalize our community colleges, which are a career pathway to the children of so many working families.  (applause.) to make college more affordable, this bill will finally end the unwarranted taxpayer subsidies that go to banks for student loans.  (applause.)  instead, let\\'s take that money and give families a $10,000 tax credit for four years of college and increase pell grants.  (applause.)  and let\\'s tell another one million students that when they graduate, they will be required to pay only 10 percent of their income on student loans, and all of their debt will be forgiven after 20 years –- and forgiven after 10 years if they choose a career in public service, because in the united states of america, no one should go broke because they chose to go to college.  (applause.) and by the way, it\\'s time for colleges and universities to get serious about cutting their own costs -– (applause) -- because they, too, have a responsibility to help solve this problem. now, the price of college tuition is just one of the burdens facing the middle class.  that\\'s why last year i asked vice president biden to chair a task force on middle-class families.  that\\'s why we\\'re nearly doubling the child care tax credit, and making it easier to save for retirement by giving access to every worker a retirement account and expanding the tax credit for those who start a nest egg.  that\\'s why we\\'re working to lift the value of a family\\'s single largest investment –- their home.  the steps we took last year to shore up the housing market have allowed millions of americans to take out new loans and save an average of $1,500 on mortgage payments.     this year, we will step up refinancing so that homeowners can move into more affordable mortgages.  (applause.)  and it is precisely to relieve the burden on middle-class families that we still need health insurance reform.  (applause.)  yes, we do.  (applause.)now, let\\'s clear a few things up.  (laughter.)  i didn\\'t choose to tackle this issue to get some legislative victory under my belt.  and by now it should be fairly obvious that i didn\\'t take on health care because it was good politics.  (laughter.)  i took on health care because of the stories i\\'ve heard from americans with preexisting conditions whose lives depend on getting coverage; patients who\\'ve been denied coverage; families –- even those with insurance -– who are just one illness away from financial ruin.after nearly a century of trying -- democratic administrations, republican administrations -- we are closer than ever to bringing more security to the lives of so many americans.  the approach we\\'ve taken would protect every american from the worst practices of the insurance industry.  it would give small businesses and uninsured americans a chance to choose an affordable health care plan in a competitive market.  it would require every insurance plan to cover preventive care. and by the way, i want to acknowledge our first lady, michelle obama, who this year is creating a national movement to tackle the epidemic of childhood obesity and make kids healthier. (applause.)  thank you.  she gets embarrassed.  (laughter.)our approach would preserve the right of americans who have insurance to keep their doctor and their plan.  it would reduce costs and premiums for millions of families and businesses.  and according to the congressional budget office -– the independent organization that both parties have cited as the official scorekeeper for congress –- our approach would bring down the deficit by as much as $1 trillion over the next two decades.  (applause.)still, this is a complex issue, and the longer it was debated, the more skeptical people became.  i take my share of the blame for not explaining it more clearly to the american people.  and i know that with all the lobbying and horse-trading, the process left most americans wondering, \"what\\'s in it for me?\"but i also know this problem is not going away.  by the time i\\'m finished speaking tonight, more americans will have lost their health insurance.  millions will lose it this year.  our deficit will grow.  premiums will go up.  patients will be denied the care they need.  small business owners will continue to drop coverage altogether.  i will not walk away from these americans, and neither should the people in this chamber.  (applause.)so, as temperatures cool, i want everyone to take another look at the plan we\\'ve proposed.  there\\'s a reason why many doctors, nurses, and health care experts who know our system best consider this approach a vast improvement over the status quo.  but if anyone from either party has a better approach that will bring down premiums, bring down the deficit, cover the uninsured, strengthen medicare for seniors, and stop insurance company abuses, let me know.  (applause.)  let me know.  let me know.  (applause.)  i\\'m eager to see it. here\\'s what i ask congress, though:  don\\'t walk away from reform.  not now.  not when we are so close.  let us find a way to come together and finish the job for the american people.  (applause.)  let\\'s get it done.  let\\'s get it done.  (applause.)now, even as health care reform would reduce our deficit, it\\'s not enough to dig us out of a massive fiscal hole in which we find ourselves.  it\\'s a challenge that makes all others that much harder to solve, and one that\\'s been subject to a lot of political posturing.  so let me start the discussion of government spending by setting the record straight. at the beginning of the last decade, the year 2000, america had a budget surplus of over $200 billion.  (applause.)  by the time i took office, we had a one-year deficit of over $1 trillion and projected deficits of $8 trillion over the next decade.  most of this was the result of not paying for two wars, two tax cuts, and an expensive prescription drug program.  on top of that, the effects of the recession put a $3 trillion hole in our budget.  all this was before i walked in the door.  (laughter and applause.)now -- just stating the facts.  now, if we had taken office in ordinary times, i would have liked nothing more than to start bringing down the deficit.  but we took office amid a crisis.  and our efforts to prevent a second depression have added another $1 trillion to our national debt.  that, too, is a fact.i\\'m absolutely convinced that was the right thing to do.  but families across the country are tightening their belts and making tough decisions.  the federal government should do the same.  (applause.)  so tonight, i\\'m proposing specific steps to pay for the trillion dollars that it took to rescue the economy last year.starting in 2011, we are prepared to freeze government spending for three years.  (applause.)  spending related to our national security, medicare, medicaid, and social security will not be affected.  but all other discretionary government programs will.  like any cash-strapped family, we will work within a budget to invest in what we need and sacrifice what we don\\'t.  and if i have to enforce this discipline by veto, i will.  (applause.)  we will continue to go through the budget, line by line, page by page, to eliminate programs that we can\\'t afford and don\\'t work.  we\\'ve already identified $20 billion in savings for next year.  to help working families, we\\'ll extend our middle-class tax cuts.  but at a time of record deficits, we will not continue tax cuts for oil companies, for investment fund managers, and for those making over $250,000 a year.  we just can\\'t afford it.  (applause.) now, even after paying for what we spent on my watch, we\\'ll still face the massive deficit we had when i took office.  more importantly, the cost of medicare, medicaid, and social security will continue to skyrocket.  that\\'s why i\\'ve called for a bipartisan fiscal commission, modeled on a proposal by republican judd gregg and democrat kent conrad.  (applause.)  this can\\'t be one of those washington gimmicks that lets us pretend we solved a problem.  the commission will have to provide a specific set of solutions by a certain deadline. now, yesterday, the senate blocked a bill that would have created this commission.  so i\\'ll issue an executive order that will allow us to go forward, because i refuse to pass this problem on to another generation of americans.  (applause.)  and when the vote comes tomorrow, the senate should restore the pay-as-you-go law that was a big reason for why we had record surpluses in the 1990s.  (applause.) now, i know that some in my own party will argue that we can\\'t address the deficit or freeze government spending when so many are still hurting.  and i agree -- which is why this freeze won\\'t take effect until next year -- (laughter) -- when the economy is stronger.  that\\'s how budgeting works.  (laughter and applause.)  but understand –- understand if we don\\'t take meaningful steps to rein in our debt, it could damage our markets, increase the cost of borrowing, and jeopardize our recovery -– all of which would have an even worse effect on our job growth and family incomes. from some on the right, i expect we\\'ll hear a different argument -– that if we just make fewer investments in our people, extend tax cuts including those for the wealthier americans, eliminate more regulations, maintain the status quo on health care, our deficits will go away.  the problem is that\\'s what we did for eight years.  (applause.)  that\\'s what helped us into this crisis.  it\\'s what helped lead to these deficits.  we can\\'t do it again.rather than fight the same tired battles that have dominated washington for decades, it\\'s time to try something new.  let\\'s invest in our people without leaving them a mountain of debt.  let\\'s meet our responsibility to the citizens who sent us here.  let\\'s try common sense.  (laughter.)  a novel concept.to do that, we have to recognize that we face more than a deficit of dollars right now.  we face a deficit of trust -– deep and corrosive doubts about how washington works that have been growing for years.  to close that credibility gap we have to take action on both ends of pennsylvania avenue -- to end the outsized influence of lobbyists; to do our work openly; to give our people the government they deserve.  (applause.)that\\'s what i came to washington to do.  that\\'s why -– for the first time in history –- my administration posts on our white house visitors online.  that\\'s why we\\'ve excluded lobbyists from policymaking jobs, or seats on federal boards and commissions.but we can\\'t stop there.  it\\'s time to require lobbyists to disclose each contact they make on behalf of a client with my administration or with congress.  it\\'s time to put strict limits on the contributions that lobbyists give to candidates for federal office. with all due deference to separation of powers, last week the supreme court reversed a century of law that i believe will open the floodgates for special interests –- including foreign corporations –- to spend without limit in our elections.  (applause.)  i don\\'t think american elections should be bankrolled by america\\'s most powerful interests, or worse, by foreign entities.  (applause.)  they should be decided by the american people.  and i\\'d urge democrats and republicans to pass a bill that helps to correct some of these problems.i\\'m also calling on congress to continue down the path of earmark reform.  (applause.)  democrats and republicans.  (applause.)  democrats and republicans.  you\\'ve trimmed some of this spending, you\\'ve embraced some meaningful change.  but restoring the public trust demands more.  for example, some members of congress post some earmark requests online.  (applause.)  tonight, i\\'m calling on congress to publish all earmark requests on a single web site before there\\'s a vote, so that the american people can see how their money is being spent. (applause.)of course, none of these reforms will even happen if we don\\'t also reform how we work with one another.  now, i\\'m not naïve.  i never thought that the mere fact of my election would usher in peace and harmony -- (laughter) -- and some post-partisan era.  i knew that both parties have fed divisions that are deeply entrenched.  and on some issues, there are simply philosophical differences that will always cause us to part ways. these disagreements, about the role of government in our lives, about our national priorities and our national security, they\\'ve been taking place for over 200 years.  they\\'re the very essence of our democracy.but what frustrates the american people is a washington where every day is election day.  we can\\'t wage a perpetual campaign where the only goal is to see who can get the most embarrassing headlines about the other side -– a belief that if you lose, i win.  neither party should delay or obstruct every single bill just because they can.  the confirmation of -- (applause) -- i\\'m speaking to both parties now.  the confirmation of well-qualified public servants shouldn\\'t be held hostage to the pet projects or grudges of a few individual senators.  (applause.) washington may think that saying anything about the other side, no matter how false, no matter how malicious, is just part of the game.  but it\\'s precisely such politics that has stopped either party from helping the american people.  worse yet, it\\'s sowing further division among our citizens, further distrust in our government.so, no, i will not give up on trying to change the tone of our politics.  i know it\\'s an election year.  and after last week, it\\'s clear that campaign fever has come even earlier than usual.  but we still need to govern. to democrats, i would remind you that we still have the largest majority in decades, and the people expect us to solve problems, not run for the hills.  (applause.)  and if the republican leadership is going to insist that 60 votes in the senate are required to do any business at all in this town -- a supermajority -- then the responsibility to govern is now yours as well.  (applause.)  just saying no to everything may be good short-term politics, but it\\'s not leadership.  we were sent here to serve our citizens, not our ambitions.  (applause.)  so let\\'s show the american people that we can do it together.  (applause.)this week, i\\'ll be addressing a meeting of the house republicans.  i\\'d like to begin monthly meetings with both democratic and republican leadership.  i know you can\\'t wait.  (laughter.)throughout our history, no issue has united this country more than our security.  sadly, some of the unity we felt after 9/11 has dissipated.  we can argue all we want about who\\'s to blame for this, but i\\'m not interested in re-litigating the past. i know that all of us love this country.  all of us are committed to its defense.  so let\\'s put aside the schoolyard taunts about who\\'s tough.  let\\'s reject the false choice between protecting our people and upholding our values.  let\\'s leave behind the fear and division, and do what it takes to defend our nation and forge a more hopeful future -- for america and for the world.  (applause.)that\\'s the work we began last year.  since the day i took office, we\\'ve renewed our focus on the terrorists who threaten our nation.  we\\'ve made substantial investments in our homeland security and disrupted plots that threatened to take american lives.  we are filling unacceptable gaps revealed by the failed christmas attack, with better airline security and swifter action on our intelligence.  we\\'ve prohibited torture and strengthened partnerships from the pacific to south asia to the arabian peninsula.  and in the last year, hundreds of al qaeda\\'s fighters and affiliates, including many senior leaders, have been captured or killed -- far more than in 2008.and in afghanistan, we\\'re increasing our troops and training afghan security forces so they can begin to take the lead in july of 2011, and our troops can begin to come home.  (applause.)  we will reward good governance, work to reduce corruption, and support the rights of all afghans -- men and women alike.  (applause.)  we\\'re joined by allies and partners who have increased their own commitments, and who will come together tomorrow in london to reaffirm our common purpose.  there will be difficult days ahead.  but i am absolutely confident we will succeed.as we take the fight to al qaeda, we are responsibly leaving iraq to its people.  as a candidate, i promised that i would end this war, and that is what i am doing as president.  we will have all of our combat troops out of iraq by the end of this august.  (applause.)  we will support the iraqi government -- we will support the iraqi government as they hold elections, and we will continue to partner with the iraqi people to promote regional peace and prosperity.  but make no mistake:  this war is ending, and all of our troops are coming home.  (applause.)   tonight, all of our men and women in uniform -- in iraq, in afghanistan, and around the world –- they have to know that we -- that they have our respect, our gratitude, our full support.  and just as they must have the resources they need in war, we all have a responsibility to support them when they come home.  (applause.)  that\\'s why we made the largest increase in investments for veterans in decades -- last year.  (applause.)   that\\'s why we\\'re building a 21st century va.  and that\\'s why michelle has joined with jill biden to forge a national commitment to support military families.  (applause.)now, even as we prosecute two wars, we\\'re also confronting perhaps the greatest danger to the american people -– the threat of nuclear weapons.  i\\'ve embraced the vision of john f. kennedy and ronald reagan through a strategy that reverses the spread of these weapons and seeks a world without them.  to reduce our stockpiles and launchers, while ensuring our deterrent, the united states and russia are completing negotiations on the farthest-reaching arms control treaty in nearly two decades.  (applause.)  and at april\\'s nuclear security summit, we will bring 44 nations together here in washington, d.c. behind a clear goal:  securing all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world in four years, so that they never fall into the hands of terrorists.  (applause.)now, these diplomatic efforts have also strengthened our hand in dealing with those nations that insist on violating international agreements in pursuit of nuclear weapons.  that\\'s why north korea now faces increased isolation, and stronger sanctions –- sanctions that are being vigorously enforced.  that\\'s why the international community is more united, and the islamic republic of iran is more isolated.  and as iran\\'s leaders continue to ignore their obligations, there should be no doubt:  they, too, will face growing consequences.  that is a promise.  (applause.)that\\'s the leadership that we are providing –- engagement that advances the common security and prosperity of all people. we\\'re working through the g20 to sustain a lasting global recovery.  we\\'re working with muslim communities around the world to promote science and education and innovation.  we have gone from a bystander to a leader in the fight against climate change. we\\'re helping developing countries to feed themselves, and continuing the fight against hiv/aids.  and we are launching a new initiative that will give us the capacity to respond faster and more effectively to bioterrorism or an infectious disease -– a plan that will counter threats at home and strengthen public health abroad.as we have for over 60 years, america takes these actions because our destiny is connected to those beyond our shores.  but we also do it because it is right.  that\\'s why, as we meet here tonight, over 10,000 americans are working with many nations to help the people of haiti recover and rebuild.  (applause.)  that\\'s why we stand with the girl who yearns to go to school in afghanistan; why we support the human rights of the women marching through the streets of iran; why we advocate for the young man denied a job by corruption in guinea.  for america must always stand on the side of freedom and human dignity.  (applause.)  always.  (applause.)abroad, america\\'s greatest source of strength has always been our ideals.  the same is true at home.  we find unity in our incredible diversity, drawing on the promise enshrined in our constitution:  the notion that we\\'re all created equal; that no matter who you are or what you look like, if you abide by the law you should be protected by it; if you adhere to our common values you should be treated no different than anyone else.    we must continually renew this promise.  my administration has a civil rights division that is once again prosecuting civil rights violations and employment discrimination.  (applause.)  we finally strengthened our laws to protect against crimes driven by hate.  (applause.)  this year, i will work with congress and our military to finally repeal the law that denies gay americans the right to serve the country they love because of who they are.  (applause.)  it\\'s the right thing to do.  (applause.)  we\\'re going to crack down on violations of equal pay laws -– so that women get equal pay for an equal day\\'s work.  (applause.) and we should continue the work of fixing our broken immigration system -– to secure our borders and enforce our laws, and ensure that everyone who plays by the rules can contribute to our economy and enrich our nation.  (applause.)in the end, it\\'s our ideals, our values that built america  -- values that allowed us to forge a nation made up of immigrants from every corner of the globe; values that drive our citizens still.  every day, americans meet their responsibilities to their families and their employers.  time and again, they lend a hand to their neighbors and give back to their country.  they take pride in their labor, and are generous in spirit.  these aren\\'t republican values or democratic values that they\\'re living by; business values or labor values.  they\\'re american values.  unfortunately, too many of our citizens have lost faith that our biggest institutions -– our corporations, our media, and, yes, our government –- still reflect these same values.  each of these institutions are full of honorable men and women doing important work that helps our country prosper.  but each time a ceo rewards himself for failure, or a banker puts the rest of us at risk for his own selfish gain, people\\'s doubts grow.  each time lobbyists game the system or politicians tear each other down instead of lifting this country up, we lose faith.  the more that tv pundits reduce serious debates to silly arguments, big issues into sound bites, our citizens turn away.  no wonder there\\'s so much cynicism out there.  no wonder there\\'s so much disappointment. i campaigned on the promise of change –- change we can believe in, the slogan went.  and right now, i know there are many americans who aren\\'t sure if they still believe we can change –- or that i can deliver it. but remember this –- i never suggested that change would be easy, or that i could do it alone.  democracy in a nation of 300 million people can be noisy and messy and complicated.  and when you try to do big things and make big changes, it stirs passions and controversy.  that\\'s just how it is.those of us in public office can respond to this reality by playing it safe and avoid telling hard truths and pointing fingers.  we can do what\\'s necessary to keep our poll numbers high, and get through the next election instead of doing what\\'s best for the next generation. but i also know this:  if people had made that decision 50 years ago, or 100 years ago, or 200 years ago, we wouldn\\'t be here tonight.  the only reason we are here is because generations of americans were unafraid to do what was hard; to do what was needed even when success was uncertain; to do what it took to keep the dream of this nation alive for their children and their grandchildren.our administration has had some political setbacks this year, and some of them were deserved.  but i wake up every day knowing that they are nothing compared to the setbacks that families all across this country have faced this year.  and what keeps me going -– what keeps me fighting -– is that despite all these setbacks, that spirit of determination and optimism, that fundamental decency that has always been at the core of the american people, that lives on.   it lives on in the struggling small business owner who wrote to me of his company, \"none of us,\" he said, \"…are willing to consider, even slightly, that we might fail.\"it lives on in the woman who said that even though she and her neighbors have felt the pain of recession, \"we are strong.  we are resilient.  we are american.\"it lives on in the 8-year-old boy in louisiana, who just sent me his allowance and asked if i would give it to the people of haiti. and it lives on in all the americans who\\'ve dropped everything to go someplace they\\'ve never been and pull people they\\'ve never known from the rubble, prompting chants of \"u.s.a.! u.s.a.!  u.s.a!\" when another life was saved. the spirit that has sustained this nation for more than two centuries lives on in you, its people.  we have finished a difficult year.  we have come through a difficult decade.  but a new year has come.  a new decade stretches before us.  we don\\'t quit.  i don\\'t quit.  (applause.)  let\\'s seize this moment -- to start anew, to carry the dream forward, and to strengthen our union once more.  (applause.)thank you.  god bless you.  and god bless the united states of america.  (applause.)']\n",

      "Colunm Name :  first_clean\n",
      "Column Contents :  [\"members of the congress: in reporting to the congress the state of the union, i find it impossible to characterize it other than one of general peace and prosperity. in some quarters our diplomacy is vexed with difficult and as yet unsolved problems, but nowhere are we met with armed conflict. if some occupations and areas are not flourishing, in none does there remain any acute chronic depression. what the country requires is not so much new policies as a steady continuation of those which are already being crowned with such abundant success. it can not be too often repeated that in common with all the world we are engaged in liquidating the war. in the present short session no great amount of new legislation is possible, but in order to comprehend what is most desirable some survey of our general situation is necessary. a large amount of time is consumed in the passage of appropriation bills. if each congress in its opening session would make appropriations to continue for two years, very much time would be saved which could either be devoted to a consideration of the general needs of the country or would result in decreasing the work of legislation. economy our present state of prosperity has been greatly promoted by three important causes, one of which is economy, resulting in reduction and reform in national taxation. another is the elimination of many kinds of waste. the third is a general raising of the standards of efficiency. this combination has brought the perfectly astonishing result of a reduction in the index price of commodities and an increase in the index rate of wages. we have secured a lowering of the cost to produce and a raising of the ability to consume. prosperity resulting from these causes rests on the securest of all foundations. it gathers strength from its own progress. in promoting this progress the chief part which the national government plays lies in the field of economy. whatever doubts may have been entertained as to the necessity of this policy and the beneficial results which would accrue from it to all the people of the nation, its wisdom must now be considered thoroughly demonstrated. it may not have appeared to be a novel or perhaps brilliant conception, but it has turned out to be preeminently sound. it has not failed to work. it has surely brought results. it does not have to be excused as a temporary expedient adopted as the lesser evil to remedy some abuse, it is not. a palliative seeking to treat symptoms, but a major operation for the, eradication at the source of a large number of social diseases. nothing is easier than the expenditure of public money. it does not appear to belong to anybody. the temptation is overwhelming to bestow it on somebody. but the results of extravagance are ruinous. the property of the country, like the freedom of the country, belongs to the people of the country. they have not empowered their government to take a dollar of it except for a necessary public purpose. but if the constitution conferred such right, sound economics would forbid it. nothing is more, destructive of the progress of the nation than government extravagance. it means an increase in the burden of taxation, dissipation of the returns from enterprise, a decrease in the real value of wages, with ultimate stagnation and decay. the whole theory of our institutions is based on the liberty and independence of the individual. he is dependent on himself for support and therefore entitled to the rewards of his own industry. he is not to be deprived of what he earns that others may be benefited by what they do not earn. what lie saves through his private effort is not to be wasted by government extravagance. our national activities have become so vast that it is necessary to scrutinize each item of public expenditure if we are to apply the principle of economy. at the last session we made an immediate increase in the annual budget of more than $100,000,000 in benefits conferred on the veterans of three wars, public buildings, and river and harbor improvement. many projects are being broached requiring further large outlays. i am convinced that it would be greatly for the welfare of the country if we avoid at the present session all commitments except those of the most pressing nature. from a reduction of the debt and taxes will accrue a wider benefit to all the people of this country than from embarking on any new enterprise. when our war debt is decreased we shall have resources for expansion. until that is accomplished we should confine ourselves to expenditures of the most urgent necessity. the department of commerce has performed a most important function in making plans and securing support of all kinds of national enterprise for the elimination of waste. efficiency has been greatly promoted through good management and the constantly increasing cooperation of the wage earners throughout the whole realm of private business. it is my opinion that this whole development has been predicated on the foundation of a protective tariff. tax reduction as a result of economy of administration by the executive and of appropriation by the congress, the end of this fiscal year will leave a surplus in the treasury estimated at $383,000,000. unless otherwise ordered, such surplus is used for the retirement of the war debt. a bond which can be retired today for 100 cents will cost the, people 104 1/4 cents to retire a year from now. while i favor a speedy reduction of the debt as already required by law and in accordance with the promises made to the holders of our liberty bonds when they were issued, there is no reason why a balanced portion of surplus revenue should not be applied to a reduction of taxation. it can not be repeated too often that the enormous revenues of this nation could not be collected without becoming a charge on all the people whether or not they directly pay taxes. everyone who is paying or the bare necessities of fool and shelter and clothing, without considering the better things of life, is indirectly paying a national tax. the nearly 20,000,000 owners of securities, the additional scores of millions of holders of insurance policies and depositors in savings banks, are all paying a national tax. millions of individuals and corporations are making a direct contribution to the national treasury which runs from 11/2 to 25 per cent of their income, besides a number of special requirements, like automobile and admission taxes. whenever the state of the treasury will permit, i believe in a reduction of taxation. i think the taxpayers are entitled to it. but i am not advocating tax reduction merely for the benefit of the taxpayer; i am advocating it for the benefit of the country. if it appeared feasible, i should welcome permanent tax reduction at this time. the estimated surplus, however, for june 30, 1928, is not much larger than is required in a going business of nearly $4,000,000,000. we have had but a few months' experience under the present revenue act and shall need to know what is developed by the returns of income produced under it, which are not required t o be made until about the time this session terminates, and what the economic probabilities of the country are in the latter part of 1927, before we can reach any justifiable conclusion as to permanent tax reduction. moreover the present surplus results from many nonrecurrent items. meantime, it is possible to grant some real relief by a simple measure making reductions in the payments which accrue on the 15th of march and june, 1927. 1 am very strongly of the conviction that this is so much a purely business matter that it ought not to be dealt with in a partisan spirit. the congress has already set the notable example of treating tax problems without much reference to party, which might well be continued. what i desire to advocate most earnestly is relief for the country from unnecessary tax burdens. we can not secure that if we stop to engage in a partisan controversy. as i do not think any change in the special taxes, or tiny permanent reduction is practical, i therefore urge both parties of the house ways and means committee to agree on a bill granting the temporary relief which i have indicated. such a reduction would directly affect millions of taxpayers, release large sums for investment in new enterprise, stimulating industrial production and agricultural consumption, and indirectly benefiting every family in the whole country. these are my convictions stated with full knowledge that it is for the congress to decide whether they judge it best to make such a reduction or leave the surplus for the present year to be applied to retirement of the war debt. that also is eventually tax reduction. protective tariff it is estimated that customs receipts for the present fiscal year will exceed $615,000,000, the largest which were ever secured from that source. the value of our imports for the last fiscal year was $4,466,000,000, an increase of more than 71 per cent since the present tariff law went into effect. of these imports about 65 per cent, or, roughly, $2,900,000,000, came in free of duty, which means that the united states affords a duty-free market to other countries almost equal in value to the total imports of germany and greatly exceeding the total imports of france. we have admitted a greater volume of free imports than any other country except england. we are, therefore, levying duties on about $1,550,000,000 of imports. nearly half of this, or $700,000,000, is subject to duties for the protection of agriculture and have their origin in countries other than europe. they substantially increased the prices received by our farmers for their produce. about $300,000.000 more is represented by luxuries such as costly rugs, furs, precious stones, etc. this leaves only about $550,000,000 of our imports under a schedule of duties which is in general under consideration when there is discussion of lowering the tariff. while the duties on this small portion, representing only about 12 per cent of our imports, undoubtedly represent the difference between a fair degree of prosperity or marked depression to many of our industries and the difference between good pay and steady work or wide unemployment to many of our wage earners, it is impossible to conceive how other countries or our own importers could be greatly benefited if these duties are reduced. those who are starting an agitation for a reduction of tariff duties, partly at least for the benefit of those to whom money has been lent abroad, ought to know that there does not seem to be a very large field within the area of our imports in which probable reductions would be advantageous to foreign goods. those who wish to benefit foreign producers are much more likely to secure that result by continuing the present enormous purchasing power which comes from our prosperity that hall?' increased our imports over 71 per cent in four years than from any advantages that are likely to accrue from a general tariff reduction. agriculture the important place which agriculture holds in the economic and social life of the nation can not be overestimated. the national government is justified in putting forth every effort to make the open country a desirable place to live. no condition meets this requirement which fails to supply a fair return on labor expended and capital invested. while some localities and some particular crops furnish exceptions, in general agriculture is continuing to make progress in recovering from the depression of 1921 and 1922. animal products and food products are in a more encouraging position, while cotton, due to the high prices of past years supplemented by ideal weather conditions, has been stimulated to a point of temporary over production. acting on the request of the cotton growing interests, appointed a committee to assist in carrying out their plans. as it result of this cooperation sufficient funds have been pledged to finance the storage and carrying of 4,000,000 bales of cotton. whether those who own the cotton are willing to put a part of their stock into this plan depends on themselves. the federal government has cooperated in providing ample facilities. no method of meeting the situation would be adequate which does not contemplate a reduction of about one-third in the acreage for the coming year. the responsibility for making the plan effective lies with those who own and finance cotton and cotton lands. the department of agriculture estimates the net income of agriculture for the year 1920-21 at only $375,000,000; for 1924-25, $2,656,000,000; for 1925-26, $2,757,000,000. this increase has been brought about in part by the method already referred to, of federal tax reduction, the elimination of waste, and increased efficiency in industry. the wide gap that existed a few years ago between the index price of agricultural products and the index price of other products has been gradually closing up, though the recent depression in cotton has somewhat enlarged it. agriculture had on the whole been going higher while industry had been growing lower. industrial and commercial activities, being carried on for the most part by corporations, are taxed at a much higher rate than farming, which is carried on by individuals. this will inevitably make industrial commodity costs high while war taxation lasts. it is because of this circumstance that national tax reduction has a very large indirect benefit upon the farmer, though it can not relieve him from the very great burden of the local taxes which he pays directly. we have practically relieved the farmer of any federal income tax. there is agreement on all sides that some portions of our agricultural industry have lagged behind other industries in recovery from the war and that further improvement in methods of marketing of agricultural products is most desirable. there is belief also that the federal government can further contribute to these ends beyond the many helpful measures taken during the last five years through the different acts of congress for advancing the interests of the farmers. the packers and stockyards act, establishing of the intermediate credit banks for agricultural purposes, the purnell act for agricultural research, the capper-volstead cooperative marketing act, the cooperative marketing act of 1926, amendments to the warehousing act, the enlargement of the activities of the department of agriculture, enlargement of the scope of loans by the farm loan board, the tariff on agricultural products, the large federal expenditure in improvement of waterways and highways, the reduction of federal taxes, in all comprise a great series of governmental actions in the advancement of the special interest of agriculture. in determination of what further measures may be undertaken it seems to me there are certain pitfalls which must be avoided and our test in avoiding them should be to avoid disaster to the farmer himself. acting upon my recommendation, the congress has ordered the interstate commerce commission to investigate the freight-rate structure, directing that such changes shall be made in freight rates as will promote freedom of movement of agricultural products. railroad consolidation which i am advocating would also result in a situation where rates could be made more advantageous for farm produce, as has recently been done in the revision of rates on fertilizers in the south. additional benefit will accrue from the development of our inland waterways. the mississippi river system carries a commerce of over 50,000,000 tons at a saving of nearly $18,000,000 annually. the inland waterways corporation operates boats on 2,500 miles of navigable streams and through its relation with 165 railroads carries freight into and out of 45 states of the union. during the past six months it has handled over 1,000,000 bushels of grain monthly and by its lower freight rates has raised the price of such grain to the farmer probably 21/2 cents to 3 cents a bushel. the highway system on which the federal government expends about $85,000,000 a year is of vital importance to the rural regions. the advantages to be derived from a more comprehensive and less expensive system. of transportation for agriculture ought to be supplemented by provision for an adequate supply of fertilizer at a lower cost than it is at. present obtainable. this advantage we are attempting to secure by the proposed development at muscle shoals, and there are promising experiments being made in synthetic chemistry for the production of nitrates. a survey should be made of the relation of government grazing lands to the livestock industry. additional legislation is desirable more definitely to establish the place of grazing in the administration of the national forests, properly subordinated to their functions of producing timber and conserving the water supply. over 180,000,000 acres of grazing lands are still pastured as commons in the public domain with little or no regulation. this has made their use so uncertain that it has contributed greatly to the instability of the livestock industry. very little of this land is suited to settlement or private ownership. some plan ought to be adopted for its use in grazing, corresponding broadly to that already successfully applied to the national forests. the development of sound and strong cooperative associations is of fundamental importance to our agriculture. it is encouraging to note, therefore, that a vigorous and healthy growth in the cooperative movement is continuing. cooperative associations reporting to the department of agriculture at the end of 1925 had on their membership rolls a total of 2,700,000 producers. their total business in 1925 amounted to approximately $2,400,000,000, compared with $635,800,000 in 1915. legislative action to assist cooperative associations and supplement their efforts was passed at the last session of congress. important credit measures were also provided by congress in 1923 which have been of inestimable value to the cooperative associations. although the federal credit agencies have served agriculture well, i think it may be possible to broaden and strengthen the service of these institutions. attention is again directed to the surplus problem of agriculture by the present cotton situation. surpluses often affect prices of various farm commodities in a disastrous manner, and the problem urgently demand?, a solution. discussions both in and out of congress during the past few years have given us a better understanding of the subject, and it is my hope that out of the various proposals made the basis will be found for a sound and effective solution upon which agreement can be reached. in my opinion cooperative marketing associations will be important aids to the ultimate solution of the problem. it may well be, however, that additional measures will be needed to supplement their efforts. i believe all will agree that such measures should not conflict with the best interests of the cooperatives, but rather assist and strengthen them. in working out this problem to any sound conclusion it is necessary to avoid putting the government into the business of production or marketing or attempting to enact legislation for the purpose of price fixing. the farmer does not favor any attempted remedies that partake of these elements. he has a sincere and candid desire for assistance. if matched by an equally sincere and candid consideration of the different remedies proposed ' a sound measure of relief ought to result. it is unfortunate that no general agreement has been reached by the various agricultural interests upon any of the proposed remedies. out of the discussion of various proposals which can be had before the committees of agriculture some measure ought to be perfected which would be generally satisfactory. due to the emergency arising from a heavy tropical storm in southern florida, i authorized the secretary of agriculture to use certain funds in anticipation of legislation to enable the farmers in that region to plant their crops. the department will present a bill ratifying the loans which were made for this purpose. federal legislation has been adopted authorizing the cooperation of the government with states and private owners in the protection of forest lands from fire.this preventive measure is of such great importance that i have recommended for it an increased appropriation. another preventive measure of great economic and sanitary importance is the eradication of tuberculosis in cattle. active work is now in progress in one-fourth of the counties of the united states to secure this result. over 12,000,000 cattle have been under treatment, and the average degree of infection has fallen from 4.9 per cent to 2.8 per cent. he federal government is making substantial expenditures for this purpose. serious damage is threatened to the corn crop by the european corn borer. since 1917 it has spread from eastern new england westward into indiana and now covers about 100,000 square miles. it is one of the most formidable pests because it spreads rapidly and is exceedingly difficult of control. it has assumed a menace that is of national magnitude and warrants the federal government in extending its cooperation to the state and local agencies which are attempting to prevent its further spread and secure its eradication. the whole question of agriculture needs most careful consideration. in the past few years the government has given this subject more attention than any other and has held more consultations in relation to it than on any other subject. while the government is not to be blamed for failure to perform the impossible, the agricultural regions are entitled to know that they have its constant solicitude and sympathy. many of the farmers are burdened with debts and taxes which they are unable to carry. we are expending in this country many millions of dollars each year to increase farm production. we ought now to put more emphasis on the question of farm marketing. if a sound solution of a permanent nature can be found for this problem, the congress ought not to hesitate to adopt it. development of water resources in previous messages i have referred to the national importance of the proper development of our water resources. the great projects of extension of the mississippi system, the protection an development of the lower colorado river, are before congress, and i have previously commented upon them. i favor the necessary legislation to expedite these projects. engineering studies are being made for connecting the great lakes with the north atlantic either through an all-american canal or by way of the st. lawrence river. these reports will undoubtedly be before the congress during its present session. it is unnecessary to dwell upon the great importance of such a waterway not only to our mid-continental basin but to the commerce and development of practically the whole nation. our river and harbor improvement should be continued in accordance with the present policy. expenditure of this character is compatible with economy; it is in the nature of capital investment. work should proceed on the basic trunk lines if this work is to be a success. if the country will be content to be moderate and patient and permit improvements to be made where they will do the greatest general good, rather than insisting on expenditures at this time on secondary projects, our internal waterways can be made a success. if proposes legislation results in a gross manifestation of local jealousies and selfishness, this program can not be carried out. ultimately we can take care of extensions, but our first effort should be confined to the main arteries. our inland commerce has been put to great inconvenience and expense by reason of the lowering of the water level of the great lakes. this is an international problem on which competent engineers are making reports. out of their study it is expected that a feasible method will be developed for raising the level to provide relief for our commerce and supply water for drainage. whenever a practical plan is presented it ought to be speedily adopted. reclamation it is increasingly evident that the federal government must in the future take a leading part in the impounding of water for conservation with incidental power for the development of the irrigable lands of the and region. the unused waters of the west are found mainly in large rivers. works to store and distribute these have such magnitude and cost that they are not attractive to private enterprise. water is the irreplaceable natural resource. its precipitation can not be increased. its storage on the higher reaches of streams, to meet growing needs, to be used repeatedly as it flows toward the seas, is a practical and prudent business policy. the united states promises to follow the course of older irrigation countries, where recent important irrigation developments have been carried out as national undertakings. it is gratifying, therefore, that conditions on federal reclamation projects have become satisfactory. the gross value of crop,, grown with water from project works increased from $110,000,000 in 1924 to $131,000,000 in 1925. the adjustments made last year by congress relieved irrigators from paying construction costs on unprofitable land, and by so doing inspired new hope and confidence in ability to meet the payments required. construction payments by water users last year were the largest in the history of the bureau. the anticipated reclamation fund will be fully absorbed for a number of years in the completion of old projects and the construction of projects inaugurated in the past three years. we should, however, continue to investigate and study the possibilities of a carefully planned development of promising projects, logically of governmental concern because of their physical magnitude, immense cost, and the interstate and international problems involved. only in this way may we be fully prepared to meet intelligently the needs of our fast-growing population in the years to come. transportation it would be difficult to conceive of any modern activity which contributes more to the necessities and conveniences of life than transportation. without it our present agricultural production and practically all of our commerce would ?be completely prostrated. one of the large contributing causes to the present highly satisfactory state of our economic condition is the prompt and dependable service, surpassing all our previous records, rendered by the railroads. this power has been fostered by the spirit of cooperation between federal and state regulatory commissions. to render this service more efficient and effective and to promote a more scientific regulation, the process of valuing railroad properties should be simplified and the primary valuations should be completed as rapidly as possible. the problem of rate reduction would be much simplified by a process of railroad consolidations. this principle has already been adopted as federal law. experience has shown that a more effective method must be provided. studies have already been made and legislation introduced seeking to promote this end. it would be of great advantage if it could be taken up at once and speedily enacted. the railroad systems of the country and the convenience of all the people are waiting on this important decision. merchant marine it is axiomatic that no agricultural and industrial country can get the full benefit of its own advantages without a merchant marine. we have been proceeding under the act of congress that contemplates the establishment of trade routes to be ultimately transferred to private ownership and operation. due to temporary conditions abroad and at home we have a large demand just now for certain types of freight vessels. some suggestion has been made for new construction. i do not feel that we are yet warranted in entering, that field. such ships as we might build could not be sold after they are launched for anywhere near what they would cost. we have expended over $250,000,000 out of the public treasury in recent years to make up the losses of operation, not counting the depreciation or any cost whatever of our capital investment. the great need of our merchant marine is not for more ships but for more freight. our merchants are altogether too indifferent about using american ships for the transportation of goods which they send abroad or bring home. some of our vessels necessarily need repairs, which should be made. i do not believe that the operation of our fleet is as economical and efficient as it could be made if placed under a single responsible head, leaving the shipping board free to deal with general matters of policy and regulation. radio legislation the department of commerce has for some years urgently presented the necessity for further legislation in order to protect radio listeners from interference between broadcasting stations and to carry out other regulatory functions. both branches of congress at the last session passed enactments intended to effect such regulation, but the two bills yet remain to be brought into agreement and final passage. due to decisions of the courts, the authority of the department under the law of 1912 has broken down; many more stations have been operating than can be accommodated within the limited number of wave lengths available; further stations are in course of construction; many stations have departed from the scheme of allocation set down by the department, and the whole service of this most important public function has drifted into such chaos as seems likely, if not remedied, to destroy its great value. i most urgently recommend that this legislation should be speedily enacted. i do not believe it is desirable to set tip further independent agencies in the government. rather i believe it advisable to entrust the important functions of deciding who shall exercise the privilege of radio transmission and under what conditions, the assigning of wave lengths and determination of power, to a board to be assembled whenever action on such questions becomes necessary. there should be right of appeal to the courts from the decisions of such board. the administration of the decisions of the board and the other features of regulation and promotion of radio in the public interest, together with scientific research, should remain in the department of commerce. such an arrangement makes for more expert, more efficient, and more economical administration that an independent agency or board, whose duties, after initial stages, require but little attention, in which administrative functions are confused with semijudicial functions and from which of necessity there must be greatly increased personnel and expenditure. the wage earner the great body of our people are made up of wage earners. several hundred thousands of them are on the pay rolls of the united states government. their condition very largely is fixed by legislation. we have recently provided increases in compensation under a method of reclassification and given them the advantage of a liberal retirement system as a support for their declining years. most of them are under the merit system, which is a guaranty of their intelligence, and the efficiency of their service is a demonstration of their loyalty. the federal government should continue to set a good example for all other employers. in the industries the condition of the wage earner has steadily improved. the 12-hour day is almost entirely unknown. skilled labor is well compensated. but there are unfortunately a multitude of workers who have not yet come to share in the general prosperity of the nation. both the public authorities and private enterprise should be solicitous to advance the welfare of this class. the federal government has been seeking to secure this end through a protective tariff, through restrictive immigration, through requiring safety devices for the prevention of accidents, through the granting of workman's compensation, through civilian vocational rehabilitation and education, through employment information bureaus, and through such humanitarian relief as was provided in the maternity and infancy legislation. it is a satisfaction to report that a more general condition of contentment exists among wage earners and the country is more free from labor disputes than it has been for years. while restrictive immigration has been adopted in part for the benefit of the wage earner, and in its entirety for the benefit of the country, it ought not to cause a needless separation of families and dependents from their natural source of support contrary to the dictates of humanity. bituminous coal no progress appears to have been made within large areas of the bituminous coal industry toward creation of voluntary machinery by which greater assurance can be given to the public of peaceful adjustment of wage difficulties such as has been accomplished in the anthracite industry. this bituminous industry is one of primary necessity and bears a great responsibility to the nation for continuity of supplies. as the wage agreements in the unionized section of the industry expire on april 1 next, and as conflicts may result which may imperil public interest, and have for many years often called for action of the executive in protection of the public, i again recommend the passage of such legislation as will assist the executive in dealing with such emergencies through a special temporary board of conciliation and mediation and through administrative agencies for the purpose of distribution of coal and protection of the consumers of coal from profiteering. at present the executive is not only without authority to act but is actually prohibited by law from making any expenditure to meet the emergency of a coal famine. judiciary the federal courts hold a high position in the administration of justice in the world. while individual judicial officers have sometimes been subjected to just criticism, the courts as a whole have maintained an exceedingly high standard. the congress may well consider the question of supplying fair salaries and conferring upon the supreme court the same rule-making power on the law side of the district courts that they have always possessed on the equity side. a bill is also pending providing for retirement after a certain number of years of service, although they have not been consecutive, which should have your favorable consideration. these faithful servants of the government are about the last that remain to be provided for in the postwar readjustments. banking there has been pending in congress for nearly three years banking legislation to clarify the national bank act and reasonably to increase the powers of the national banks. i believe that within the limitation of sound banking principles congress should now and for the future place the national banks upon a fair equality with their competitors, the state banks, and i trust that means may be found so that the differences on branch-banking legislation between the senate and the house of representatives may be settled along sound lines and the legislation promptly enacted. it would be difficult to overestimate the service which the federal reserve system has already rendered to the country. it is necessary only to recall the chaotic condition of our banking organization at the time the federal reserve system was put into operation. the old system consisted of a vast number of independent banking units, with scattered bank reserves which never could be mobilized in times of greatest need. in spite of vast banking resources, there was no coordination of reserves or any credit elasticity. as a consequence, a strain was felt even during crop-moving periods and when it was necessary to meet other seasonal and regularly recurring needs. the federal reserve system is not a panacea for all economic or financial ills. it can not prevent depression in certain industries which are experiencing overexpansion of production or contraction of their markets. its business is to furnish adequate credit and currency facilities. this it has succeeded in doing, both during the war and in the more difficult period of deflation and readjustment which followed. it enables us to look to the future with confidence and to make plans far ahead, based on the belief that the federal reserve system will exercise a steadying influence on credit conditions and thereby prevent tiny sudden or severe reactions from the period of prosperity which we are now enjoying. in order that these plans may go forward, action should be taken at the present session on the question of renewing the banks' charters and thereby insuring a continuation of the policies and present usefulness of the federal reserve system. federal regulation i am in favor of reducing, rather than expanding, government bureaus which seek to regulate and control the business activities of the people. everyone is aware that abuses exist and will exist so long as we are limited by human imperfections. unfortunately, human nature can not be changed by an act of the legislature. when practically the sole remedy for many evils lies in the necessity of the people looking out for themselves and reforming their own abuses, they will find that they are relying on a false security if the government assumes to hold out the promise that it is looking out for them and providing reforms for them. this principle is preeminently applicable to the national government. it is too much assumed that because an abuse exists it is the business of the national government to provide a remedy. the presumption should be that it is the business of local and state governments. such national action results in encroaching upon the salutary independence of the states and by undertaking to supersede their natural authority fills the land with bureaus and departments which are undertaking to do what it is impossible for them to accomplish and brings our whole system of government into disrespect and disfavor. we ought to maintain high standards. we ought to punish wrongdoing. society has not only the privilege but the absolute duty of protecting itself and its individuals. but we can not accomplish this end by adopting a wrong method. permanent success lies in local, rather than national action. unless the locality rises to its own requirements, there is an almost irresistible impulse for the national government to intervene. the states and the nation should both realize that such action is to be adopted only as a last resort. the negro the social well-being of our country requires our constant effort for the amelioration of race prejudice and the extension to all elements of equal opportunity and equal protection under the laws which are guaranteed by the. constitution. the federal government especially is charged with this obligation in behalf of the colored people of the nation. not only their remarkable progress, their devotion and their loyalty, but, our duty to ourselves under our claim that we are an enlightened people requires us to use all our power to protect them from the crime of lynching. although violence of this kind has very much decreased, while any of it remains we can not justify neglecting to make every effort to eradicate it by law. the education of the colored race under government encouragement is proceeding successfully and ought to have continuing support. an increasing need exists for properly educated and trained medical skill to be devoted to the service of this race. insular possessions this government holds in sacred trusteeship islands which it has acquired in the east and west indies. in all of them the people are more prosperous than at any previous time. a system of good roads, education, and general development is in progress. the people are better governed than ever before and generally content. in the philippine islands maj. gen. leonard wood has been governor general for five years and has administered his office with tact and ability greatly to the success of the filipino people. these are a proud and sensitive race, who are making such progress with our cooperation that we can view the results of this experiment with great satisfaction. as we are attempting to assist this race toward self-government, we should look upon their wishes with great respect, granting their requests immediately when they are right, yet maintaining a frank firmness in refusing when they are wrong. we shall measure their progress in no small part by their acceptance of the terms of the organic law under which the islands are governed and their faithful observance of its provisions. need exists for clarifying the duties of the auditor and declaring them to be what everyone had supposed they were. we have placed our own expenditures under the supervision of the comptroller general. it is not likely that the expenditures in the philippine islands need less supervision than our own. the governor general is hampered in his selection of subordinates by the necessity of securing a confirmation, which has oftentimes driven him to the expediency of using army officers in work for which civilian experts would be much better fitted. means should be provided for this and such other purposes as he may require out of the revenue which this government now turns back to the philippine treasury. in order that these possessions might stiffer no seeming neglect, i have recently sent col. carmi a thompson to the islands to make a survey in cooperation with the governor general to suggest what might be done to improve conditions. later, i may make a more extended report including recommendations. the economic development of the islands is very important. they ought not to be turned back to the people until they are both politically fitted for self-government and economically independent. large areas are adaptable to the production of rubber. no one contemplates any time in the future either under the present or a more independent form of government when we should not assume some responsibility for their defense. for their economic advantage, for the employment of their people, and as a contribution to our power of defense which could not be carried on without rubber, i believe this industry should be encouraged. it is especially adapted to the filipino people themselves, who might cultivate it individually on a small acreage. it could be carried on extensively by american capital in a way to furnish employment at good wages. i am opposed to the promotion of any policy that does not provide for absolute freedom on the part of the wage earners and do not think we should undertake to give power for large holdings of land in the islands against the opposition of the people of the locality. any development of the islands must be solely with the first object of benefiting the people of the islands. at an early day, these possessions should be taken out from under all military control and administered entirely on the civil side of government. national defense our policy of national defense is not one of making war, but of insuring peace. the land and sea force of america, both in its domestic and foreign implications, is distinctly a peace force. it is an arm of the police power to guarantee order and the execution of the law at home and security to our citizens abroad. no self-respecting nation would neglect to provide an army and navy proportionate to its population, the extent of its territory, and the dignity of the place which it occupies in the world. when it is considered that no navy in the world, with one exception, approaches ours and none surpasses it, that our regular army of about 115,000 men is the equal of any other like number of troops, that our entire permanent and reserve land and sea force trained and training consists of a personnel of about 610,000, and that our annual appropriations are about $680,000,000 a year, expended under the direction of an exceedingly competent staff, it can not be said that our country is neglecting its national defense. it is true that a cult of disparagement exists, but that candid examination made by the congress through its various committees has always reassured the country and demonstrated that it is maintaining the most adequate defensive forces in these present years that it has ever supported in time of peace. this general policy should be kept in effect. here and there temporary changes may be made in personnel to meet requirements in other directions. attention should be given to submarines, cruisers, and air forces. particular points may need strengthening, but as a whole our military power is sufficient. the one weak place in the whole line is our still stupendous war debt. in any modern campaign the dollars are the shock troops. with a depleted treasury in the rear, no army can maintain itself in the field. a country loaded with debt is a country devoid of the first line of defense. economy is the handmaid of preparedness. if we wish to be able to defend ourselves to the full extent of our power in the future, we shall discharge as soon as possible the financial burden of the last war. otherwise we would face a crisis with a part of our capital resources already expended. the amount and kind of our military equipment is preeminently a question for the decision of the congress, after giving due consideration to the advice of military experts and the available public revenue. nothing is more laudable than the cooperation of the agricultural and industrial resources of the country for the purpose of supplying the needs of national defense. in time of peril the people employed in these interests volunteered in a most self-sacrificing way, often at the nominal charge of a dollar a year. but the army and navy are not supported for the benefit of supply concerns; supply concerns are supported for the benefit of the army and navy. the distribution of orders on what is needed from different concerns for the purpose of keeping up equipment and organization is perfectly justified, but any attempt to prevail upon the government to purchase beyond its needs ought not to be tolerated. it is eminently fair that those who deal with the government should do so at a reasonable profit. however, public money is expended not that some one may profit by it, but in order to serve a public purpose. while our policy of national defense will proceed in order that we may be independent and self-sufficient, i am opposed to engaging in any attempt at competitive armaments. no matter how much or how little some other country may feel constrained to provide, we can well afford to set the example, not of being dictated to by others, but of adopting our own standards. we are strong enough to pursue that method, which will be a most wholesome model for the rest of the world. we are eminently peaceful, but we are by no means weak. while we submit our differences with others, not to the adjudication of force, but of reason, it is not because we are unable to defend our rights. while we are doing our best to eliminate all resort to war for the purpose of settling disputes, we can not but remember that the peace we now enjoy had to be won by the sword and that if the rights of our country are to be defended we can not rely for that purpose upon anyone but ourselves. we can not shirk the responsibility, which is the first requisite of all government, of preserving its own integrity and maintaining the rights of its own citizens. it is only in accordance with these principles that we can establish any lasting foundations for an honorable and permanent peace. it is for these reasons that our country, like any other country, proposes to provide itself with an army and navy supported by a merchant marine. yet these are not for competition with any other power. for years we have besought nations to disarm. we have recently expressed our willingness at geneva to enter into treaties for the limitation of all types of warships according to the ratio adopted at the washington conference. this offer is still pending. while we are and shall continue to be armed it is not as a menace, but rather a common assurance of tranquility to all the peaceloving people of the world. for us to do any less would be to disregard our obligations, evade our responsibilities, and jeopardize our national honor. veterans this country, not only because it is bound by honor but because of the satisfaction derived from it, has always lavished its bounty upon its veterans. for years a service pension has been bestowed upon the grand army on reaching a certain age. like provision has been made for the survivors of the spanish war. a liberal future compensation has been granted to all the veterans of the world war. but it is in the case of the, disabled and the dependents that the government exhibits its greatest solicitude. this work is being well administered by the veterans' bureau. the main unfinished feature is that of hospitalization. this requirement is being rapidly met. various veteran bodies will present to you recommendations which should have your careful consideration. at the last session we increased our annual expenditure for pensions and relief on account of the veterans of three wars. while i approve of proper relief for all suffering, i do not favor any further extension of our pension system at this time. alien property we still have in the possession of the government the alien property. it has always been the policy of america to hold that private enemy property should not be confiscated in time of war. this principle we have scrupulously observed. as this property is security for the claims of our citizens and our government, we can not relinquish it without adequate provision for their reimbursement. legislation for the return of this property, accompanied by suitable provisions for the liquidation of the claims of our citizens and our treasury, should be adopted. if our government releases to foreigners the security which it holds for americans, it must at the same time provide satisfactory safeguards for meeting american claims. prohibition the duly authorized public authorities of this country have made prohibition the law of the land. acting under the constitution the congress and the legislatures of practically all the, states have adopted legislation for its enforcement. some abuses have arisen which require reform. under the law the national government has entrusted to the treasury department the especial duty of regulation and enforcement. such supplementary legislation as it requires to meet existing conditions should be carefully and speedily enacted. failure to support the constitution and observe the law ought not to be tolerated by public opinion. especially those in public places, who have taken their oath to support the constitution, ought to be most scrupulous in its observance. officers of the department of justice throughout the country should be vigilant in enforcing the law, but local authorities, which had always been mainly responsible for the enforcement of law in relation to intoxicating liquor, ought not to seek evasion by attempting to shift the burden wholly upon the federal agencies. under the constitution the states are jointly charged with the nation in providing for the enforcement of the prohibition amendment. some people do not like the amendment, some do not like other parts of the constitution, some do not like any of it. those who entertain such sentiments have a perfect right to seek through legal methods for a change. but for any of our inhabitants to observe such parts of the constitution as they like, while disregarding others, is a doctrine that would break down all protection of life and property and destroy the american system of ordered liberty. foreign relations the foreign policy of this government is well known. it is one of peace based on that mutual respect that arises from mutual regard for international rights arid the discharge of international obligations. it is our purpose to promote understanding and good will between ourselves and all other people. the american people are altogether lacking in an appreciation of the tremendous good fortune that surrounds their international position. we have no traditional enemies. we are not embarrassed over any disputed territory. we have no possessions that are coveted by others; they have none that are coveted by us. our borders are unfortified. we fear no one; no one fears us. all the world knows that the whole extent of our influence is against war and in favor of peace, against the use of force and in favor of negotiation, arbitration, and adjudication as a method of adjusting international differences. we look with disfavor upon all aggressive warfare. we are strong enough so that no one can charge us with weakness if we are slow to anger. our place is sufficiently established so that we need not be sensitive over trifles. our resources, are large enough so that we can afford to be generous. at the same time we are a nation among nations and recognize a responsibility not only to ourselves, but in the interests of a stable and enlightened civilization, to protect and defend the international rights of our government and our citizens. it is because of our historical detachment and the generations of comparative indifference toward it by other nations that our public is inclined to consider altogether too seriously the reports that we are criticized abroad. we never had a larger foreign trade than at the present time. our good offices were never more sought and the necessity for our assistance and cooperation was never more universally declared in any time of peace. we know that the sentiments which we entertain toward all other nations are those of the most sincere friendship and good will and of all unbounded desire to help, which we are perfectly willing to have judged by their fruits. in our efforts to adjust our international obligations we have met with a response which, when everything is considered, i believe history will record as a most remarkable and gratifying demonstration of the sanctity with which civilized nations undertake to discharge their mutual obligations. debt settlements have been negotiated with practically all of those who owed us and all finally adjusted but two, which are, in process of ratification. when we consider the real sacrifice that will be necessary on the part of other nations, considering all their circumstances, to meet their agreed payments, we ought to hold them in increased admiration and respect. it is true that we have extended to them very generous treatment, but it is also true that they have agreed to repay its all that we loaned to them and some interest. a special conference on the chinese customs tariff provided for by the treaty between the nine powers relating to the chinese customs tariff signed at washington on february 6, 1922, was called by the chinese government to meet at peking, on october 26, 1925. we participated in this conference through fully empowered delegates and, with good will, endeavored to cooperate with the other participating powers with a view to putting into effect promises made to china at the washington conference, and considering any reasonable proposal that might be made by the chinese government for the revision of the treaties on the subject of china's tariff. with these aims in view the american delegation at the outset of the conference proposed to put into effect the surtaxes provided for by the washington treaty and to proceed immediately to the negotiation of a treaty, which, among other things, was to make provision for the abolition of taxes collected on goods in transit, remove the tariff restrictions in existing treaties, and put into effect the national tariff law of china. early in april of the present year the central chinese government was ousted from power by opposing warring factions. it became impossible under the circumstances to continue the negotiations. finally, on july 3, the delegates of the foreign powers, including those of the united states, issued a statement expressing their unanimous and earnest desire to proceed with the work of the conference at the earliest possible moment when the delegates of the chinese government are in a position to resume discussions with the foreign delegates of the problems before the conference. we are prepared to resume the negotiations thus interrupted whenever a government representing the chinese people and acting on their behalf presents itself. the fact that constant warfare between contending chinese factions has rendered it impossible to bring these negotiations to a successful conclusion is a matter of deep regret. throughout these conflicts we have maintained a position of the most careful neutrality. our naval vessels in asiatic waters, pursuant to treaty rights, have been used only for the protection of american citizens. silas h. strawn, esq., was sent to china as american commissioner to cooperate with commissioners of the other powers in the establishment of a commission to inquire into the present practice of extraterritorial jurisdiction in china, with a view to reporting to the governments of the several powers their findings of fact in regard to these matters. the commission commenced its work in january, 1926, and agreed upon a joint report which was signed on september 16, 1926. the commission's report has been received and is being studied with a view to determining our future policy in regard to the question of extraterritorial privileges under treaties between the united states and china. the preparatory commission for the disarmament conference met at geneva on may 18 and its work has been proceeding almost continuously since that date. it would be premature to attempt to form a judgment as to the progress that has been made. the commission has had before it a comprehensive list of questions touching upon all aspects of the question of the limitation of armament. in the commission's discussions many differences of opinion have developed. however, i am hopeful that at least some measure of agreement will be reached as the discussions continue. the american representation on the commission has consistently tried to be helpful, and has kept before it the practical objective to which the commission is working, namely, actual agreements for the limitation of armaments. our representatives will continue their work in that direction. one of the most encouraging features of the commission's work thus far has been the agreement in principle among the naval experts of a majority of the powers parties to the washington treaty limiting naval armament upon methods and standards for the comparison and further limitation of naval armament. it is needless to say that at the proper time i shall be prepared to proceed along practical lines to the conclusion of agreements carrying further the work begun at the washington conference in 1921. department reports many important subjects which it is impossible even to mention in the short space of an annual message you will find fully discussed in the departmental reports. a failure to include them here is not to be taken as indicating any lack of interest, but only a disinclination to state inadequately what has been much better done in other documents. the capital city we are embarking on an ambitious building program for the city of washington. the memorial bridge is under way with all that it holds for use and beauty. new buildings are soon contemplated. this program should represent the best that exists in the art and science of architecture. into these structures which must be considered as of a permanent nature ought to go the aspirations of the nation, its ideals expressed in forms of beauty. if our country wishes to compete with others, let it not be in the support of armaments but in the making of a beautiful capital city. let it express the soul of america. whenever an american is at the seat of his government, however traveled and cultured he may be, he ought to find a city of stately proportion, symmetrically laid out and adorned with the best that there is in architecture, which would arouse his imagination and stir his patriotic pride. in the coming years washington should be not only the art center of our own country but the art center of the world. around it should center all that is best in science, in learning, in letters, and in art. these are the results that justify the creation of those national resources with which we have been favored. american ideals america is not and must not be a country without ideals. they are useless if they are only visionary; they are only valuable if they are practical. a nation can not dwell constantly on the mountain tops. it has to be replenished and sustained through the ceaseless toil of the less inspiring valleys. but its face ought always to be turned upward, its vision ought always to be fixed on high. we need ideals that can be followed in daily life, that can be translated into terms of the home. we can not expect to be relieved from toil, but we do expect to divest it of degrading conditions. work is honorable; it is entitled to an honorable recompense. we must strive mightily, but having striven there is a defect in our political and social system if we are not in general rewarded with success. to relieve the land of the burdens that came from the war, to release to the individual more of the fruits of his own industry, to increase his earning capacity and decrease his hours of labor, to enlarge the circle of his vision through good roads and better transportation, to lace before him the opportunity for education both in science and in art, to leave him free to receive the inspiration of religion, all these are ideals which deliver him from the servitude of the body and exalt him to the service of the soul. through this emancipation from the things that are material, we broaden our dominion over the things that are spiritual.\"\n",
      " \"members of the congress: it is gratifying to report that for the fourth consecutive year the state of the union in general is good. we are at peace. the country as a whole has had a prosperity never exceeded. wages are at their highest range, employment is plentiful. some parts of agriculture and industry have lagged; some localities have suffered from storm and flood. but such losses have been absorbed without serious detriment to our great economic structure. stocks of goods are moderate and a wholesome caution is prevalent. rates of interest for industry, agriculture, and government have been reduced. savers and investors are providing capital for new construction in industry and public works. the purchasing power of agriculture has increased. if the people maintain that confidence which they are entitled to have in themselves, in each other, and in america, a comfortable prosperity will continue. constructive economy without constructive economy in government expenditures we should not now be enjoying these results or these prospects. because we are not now physically at war, some people are disposed to forget that our war debt still remains. the nation must make financial sacrifices, accompanied by a stern self-denial in public expenditures, until we have conquered the disabilities of our public finance. while our obligation to veterans and dependents is large and continuing, the heavier burden of the national debt is being steadily eliminated. at the end of this fiscal year it will be reduced from about $26,600,000,000 to about $17,975,000,000. annual interest, including war savings, will have been reduced from $1,055,000,000 to $670,0001,000. the sacrifices of the people, the economy of the government, are showing remarkable results. they should be continued for the purpose of relieving the nation of the burden of interest and debt and releasing revenue for internal improvements and national development. not only the amount, but the rate, of government interest has been reduced. callable bonds have been refunded and paid, so that during this year the average rate of interest on the present public debt for the first time fell below 4 per cent. keeping the credit of the nation high is a tremendously profitable operation. tax reduction the immediate fruit of economy and the retirement of the public debt is tax reduction. the annual saving in interest between 1925 and 1929 is $212,000,000. without this no bill to relieve the taxpayers would be worth proposing. the three measures already enacted leave our government revenues where they are not oppressive. exemptions, have been increased until 115,000,000 people make but 2,500,000 individual taxable returns, so that further reduction should be mainly for the purpose of removing inequalities. the secretary of the treasury has recommended a measure which would give us a much better balanced system of taxation and without oppression produce sufficient revenue. it has my complete support. unforeseen contingencies requiring money are always arising. our probable surplus for june 30, 1929, is small. a slight depression in business would greatly reduce our revenue because of our present method of taxation. the people ought to take no selfish attitude of pressing for removing moderate and fair taxes which might produce a deficit. we must keep our budget balanced for each year. that is the corner stone of our national credit, the trifling price we pay to command the lowest rate of interest of any great power in the world. any surplus can be applied to debt reduction, and debt reduction is tax reduction. under the present circumstances it would be far better to leave the rates as they are than to enact a bill carrying the peril of a deficit. this is not a problem to be approached in a narrow or partisan spirit. all of those who participate in finding a reasonable solution will be entitled to participate in any credit that accrues from it without regard to party. the congress has already demonstrated that tax legislation can be removed from purely political consideration into the realm of patriotic business principles. any bill for tax reduction should be written by those who are responsible for raising, managing, and expending the finances of the government. if special interests, too often selfish, always uninformed of the national needs as a whole, with hired agents using their proposed beneficiaries as engines of propaganda, are permitted to influence the withdrawal of their property from taxation, we shall have a law that is unbalanced and unjust, bad for business, bad for the country, probably resulting in a deficit, with disastrous financial consequences. the constitution has given the members of the congress sole authority to decide what tax measures shall be presented for approval. while welcoming information from any quarter, the congress should continue to exercise its own judgment in a matter so vital and important to all the interests of the country as taxation. national defense being a nation relying not on force, but on fair dealing and good will, to maintain peace with others, we have provided a moderate military force in a form adapted solely to defense. it should be continued with a very generous supply of officers and with the present base of personnel, subject to fluctuations which may be temporarily desirable. the five-year program for our air forces is in keeping with this same policy and commensurate with the notable contributions of america to the science of aeronautics. the provisions of the law lately enacted are being executed as fast as the practical difficulties of an orderly and stable development permit. while our army is small, prudence requires that it should be kept in a high state of efficiency and provided with such supplies as would permit of its immediate expansion. the garrison ration has lately been increased. recommendations for an appropriation of $6,166,000 for new housing made to the previous congress failed to pass. while most of the army is well housed, some of it which is quartered in wartime training camps is becoming poorly housed. in the past three years $12,533,000 have been appropriated for reconstruction and repairs, and an authorization has been approved of $22,301,000 for new housing, under which $8,070,000 has already been appropriated. a law has also been passed, complying with the request of the war department, allocating funds received from the sale of buildings and land for housing purposes. the work, however, is not completed, so that other appropriations are being recommended. our navy is likewise a weapon of defense. we have a foreign commerce and ocean lines of trade unsurpassed by any other country. we have outlying territory in the two great oceans and long stretches of seacoast studded with the richest cities in the world. we are responsible for the protection of a large population and the greatest treasure ever bestowed upon any people. we are charged with an international duty of defending the panama canal. to meet these responsibilities we need a very substantial sea armament. it needs aircraft development, which is being provided under the five-year program. it needs submarines as soon as the department decides upon the best type of construction. it needs airplane carriers and a material addition to its force of cruisers. we can plan for the future and begin a moderate building program. this country has put away the old world policy of competitive armaments. it can never be relieved of the responsibility of adequate national defense. we have one treaty secured by an unprecedented attitude of generosity on our part for a limitation in naval armament. after most careful preparation, extending over months, we recently made every effort to secure a three-power treaty to the same end. we were granted much cooperation by japan, but we were unable to come to an agreement with great britain. while the results of the conference were of considerable value, they were mostly of a negative character. we know now that no agreement can be reached which will be inconsistent with a considerable building program on our part. we are ready and willing to continue the preparatory investigations on the general subject of limitation of armaments which have been started under the auspices of the league of nations. we have a considerable cruiser tonnage, but a part of it is obsolete. everyone knew that had a three-power agreement been reached it would have left us with the necessity of continuing our building program. the failure to agree should not cause us to build either more or less than we otherwise should. any future treaty of limitation will call on us for more ships. we should enter on no competition. we should refrain from no needful program. it should be made clear to all the world that lacking a definite agreement, the attitude of any other country is not to be permitted to alter our own policy. it should especially be demonstrated that propaganda will not cause us to change our course. where there is no treaty limitation, the size of the navy which america is to have will be solely for america to determine. no outside influence should enlarge it or diminish it. but it should be known to all that our military power holds no threat of aggrandizement. it is a guaranty of peace and security at home, and when it goes abroad it is an instrument for the protection of the legal rights of our citizens under international law, a refuge in time of disorder, and always the servant of world peace. wherever our flag goes the rights of humanity increase. merchant marine the united states government fleet is transporting a large amount of freight and reducing its drain on the treasury. the shipping board is constantly under pressure, to which it too often yields, to protect private interests, rather than serve the public welfare. more attention should be given to merchant ships as an auxiliary of the navy. the possibility of including their masters and crews in the naval reserve, with some reasonable compensation, should be thoroughly explored as a method of encouraging private operation of shipping. public operation is not a success. no investigation, of which i have caused several to be made, has failed to report that it could not succeed or to recommend speedy transfer to private ownership. our exporters and importers are both indifferent about using american ships. it should be our policy to keep our present vessels in repair and dispose of them as rapidly as possible, rather than undertake any new construction. their operation is a burden on the national treasury, for which we are not receiving sufficient benefits. commercial aviation a rapid growth is taking place in aeronautics. the department of commerce has charge of the inspection and licensing system and the construction of national airways. almost 8,000 miles are already completed and about 4,000 miles more contemplated. nearly 4,400 miles are now equipped and over 3,000 miles more will have lighting and emergency landing fields by next july. air mail contracts are expected to cover 24 of these lines. daily airway flying is nearly 15,000 miles and is expected to reach 25,000 miles early next year. flights for other purposes exceed 22,000 miles each day. over 900 airports, completed and uncompleted, have been laid out. the demand for aircraft has greatly increased. the policy already adopted by the congress is producing the sound development of this coming industry. western hemisphere air mail private enterprise is showing much interest in opening up aviation service to mexico and central and south america. we are particularly solicitous to have the united states take a leading part in this development. it is understood that the governments of our sister countries would be willing to cooperate. their physical features, the undeveloped state of their transportation, make an air service especially adaptable to their usage. the post office department should be granted power to make liberal long-term contracts for carrying our mail, and authority should be given to the army and the navy to detail aviators and planes to cooperate with private enterprise in establishing such mail service with the consent of the countries concerned. a committee of the cabinet will later present a report on this subject. good roads the importance and benefit of good roads is more and more coming to be appreciated. the national government has been making liberal contributions to encourage their construction. the results and benefits have been very gratifying. national participation, however, should be confined to trunk-line systems. the national tax on automobiles is now nearly sufficient to meet this outlay. this tax is very small, and on low-priced cars is not more than $2 or $3 each year. while the advantage of having good roads is very large, the desire for improved highways is not limited to our own country. it should and does include all the western hemisphere. the principal points in canada are already accessible. we ought to lend our encouragement in any way we can for more good roads to all the principal points in this hemisphere south of the rio grande. it has been our practice to supply these countries with military and naval advisers, when they have requested it, to assist them in national defense. the arts of peace are even more important to them and to us. authority should be given by law to provide them at their request with engineering advisers for the construction of roads and bridges. in some of these countries already wonderful progress is being made in road building, but the engineering features are often very exacting and the financing difficult. private interests should look with favor on all reasonable loans sought by these countries to open such main lines of travel. this general subject has been promoted by the pan american congress of highways, which will convene again at rio de janeiro in july, 1928. it is desirable that the congress should provide for the appointment of delegates to represent the government of the united states. cuban parcel post we have a temporary parcel-post convention with cuba. the advantage of it is all on our side. during 1926 we shipped twelve times as many parcels, weighing twenty-four times as much, as we received. this convention was made on the understanding that we would repeal an old law prohibiting the importation of cigars and cigarettes in quantities less than 3,000 enacted in 1866 to discourage smuggling, for which it has long been unnecessary. this law unjustly discriminates against an important industry of cuba. its repeal has been recommended by the treasury and post office departments. unless this is done our merchants and railroads will find themselves deprived of this large parcel-post business after the 1st of next march, the date of the expiration of the convention, which has been extended upon the specific understanding that it would expire at that time unless this legislation was enacted. we purchase large quantities of tobacco made in cuba. it is not probable that our purchases would be any larger if this law was repealed, while it would be an advantage to many other industries in the united states. insular possessions conditions in the philippine islands have been steadily improved. contentment and good order prevail. roads, irrigation works, harbor improvements, and public buildings are being constructed. public education and sanitation have been advanced. the government is in a sound financial condition. these immediate results were especially due to the administration of gov. gen. leonard wood. the six years of his governorship marked a distinct improvement in the islands and rank as one of the outstanding accomplishments of this distinguished man. his death is a loss to the nation and the islands. greater progress could be made, more efficiency could be put. into administration, if the congress would undertake to expend, through its appropriating power, all or a part of the customs revenues which are now turned over to the philippine treasury. the powers of the auditor of the islands also need revision and clarification. the government of the islands is about 98 per cent in the hands of the filipinos. an extension of the policy of self-government will be hastened by the demonstration on their part of their desire and their ability to carry out cordially and efficiently the provisions of the organic law enacted by the congress for the government of the islands. it would be well for a committee of the congress to visit the islands every two years. a fair degree of progress is being made in porto rico. its agricultural products are increasing; its treasury position, which has given much concern, shows improvement. i am advised by the governor that educational facilities are still lacking. roads are being constructed, which he represents are the first requisite for building schoolhouses. the loyalty of the island to the united states is exceedingly gratifying. a memorial will be presented to you requesting authority to have the governor elected by the people of porto rico. this was never done in the case of our own territories. it is admitted that education outside of the towns is as yet very deficient. until it has progressed further the efficiency of the government and the happiness of the people may need the guiding hand of an appointed governor. as it is not contemplated that any change should be made immediately, the general subject may well have the thoughtful study of the congress. panama canal the number of commercial ships passing through the panama canal has increased from 3,967 in 1923 to 5,475 in 1927. the total amount of tolls turned into the treasury is over $166,000,000, while all the operations of the canal have yielded a surplus of about $80,000,000. in order to provide additional storage of water and give some control over the floods of the chagres river, it is proposed to erect a dam to cost about $12,000,000 at alhajuela. it will take some five years to complete this work. agriculture the past year has seen a marked improvement in the general condition of agriculture. production is better balanced and without acute shortage or heavy surplus. costs have been reduced and the average output of the worker increased. the level of farm prices has risen while others have fallen, so that the purchasing power of the farmer is approaching a normal figure. the individual farmer is entitled to great credit for the progress made since 1921. he has adjusted his production and through cooperative organizations and other methods improved his marketing. he is using authenticated facts and employing sound methods which other industries are obliged to use to secure stability and prosperity. the old-fashioned haphazard system is being abandoned, economics are being applied to ascertain the best adapted unit of land, diversification is being promoted, and scientific methods are being used in production, and business principles in marketing. agriculture has not fully recovered from postwar depression. the fact is that economic progress never marches forward in a straight line. it goes in waves. one part goes ahead, while another halts and another recedes. everybody wishes agriculture to prosper. any sound and workable proposal to help the farmer will have the earnest support of the government. their interests are not all identical. legislation should assist as many producers in as many regions as possible. it should be the aim to assist the farmer to work out his own salvation socially and economically. no plan will be of any permanent value to him which does not leave him standing on his own foundation. in the past the government has spent vast sums to bring land under cultivation. lt. is apparent that this has reached temporarily the saturation point. we have had a surplus of production and a poor market for land, which has only lately shown signs of improvement. the main problem which is presented for solution is one of dealing with a surplus of production. it is useless to propose a temporary expedient. what is needed is permanency and stability. government price fixing is known to be unsound and bound to result in disaster. a government subsidy would work out in the same way. it can not be sound for all of the people to hire some of the people to produce a crop which neither the producers nor the rest of the people want. price fixing and subsidy will both increase the surplus, instead of diminishing it. putting the government directly into business is merely a combination of subsidy and price fixing aggravated by political pressure. these expedients would lead logically to telling the farmer by law what and how much he should plant and where he should plant it, and what and how much he should sell and where he should sell it. the most effective means of dealing with surplus crops is to reduce the surplus acreage. while this can not be done by the individual farmer, it can be done through the organizations already in existence, through the information published by the department of agriculture, and especially through banks and others who supply credit refusing to finance an acreage manifestly too large. it is impossible to provide by law for an assured success and prosperity for all those who engage in farming. if acreage becomes overextended, the government can not assume responsibility for it. the government can, however, assist cooperative associations and other organizations in orderly marketing and handling a surplus clearly due to weather and seasonal conditions, in order to save the producer from preventable loss. while it is probably impossible to secure this result at a single step, and much will have to be worked out by trial and rejection, a beginning could be made by setting up a federal board or commission of able and experienced men in marketing, granting equal advantages under this board to the various agricultural commodities and sections of the country, giving encouragement to the cooperative movement in agriculture, and providing a revolving loan fund at a moderate rate of interest for the necessary financing. such legislation would lay the foundation for a permanent solution of the surplus problem. this is not a proposal to lend more money to the farmer, who is already fairly well financed, but to lend money temporarily to experimental marketing associations which will no doubt ultimately be financed by the regularly established banks, as were the temporary operations of the war finance corporation. cooperative marketing especially would be provided with means of buying or building physical properties. the national government has almost entirely relieved the farmer from income taxes by successive tax reductions, but state and local taxes have increased, putting on him a grievous burden. a policy of rigid economy should be applied to state and local expenditures. this is clearly within the legislative domain of the states. the federal government has also improved our banking structure and system of agricultural credits. the farmer will be greatly benefited by similar action in many states. the department of agriculture is undergoing changes in organization in order more completely to separate the research and regulatory divisions, that each may be better administered. more emphasis is being placed on the research program, not only by enlarging the appropriations for state experiment stations but by providing funds for expanding the research work of the department. it is in this direction that much future progress can be expected. the protective tariff the present tariff rates supply the national treasury with well over $600,000,000 of annual revenue. yet, about 65 per cent of our imports come in duty free. of the remaining 35 per cent of imports on which duties are laid about 23 per cent consists of luxuries and agricultural products, and the balance of about 12 per cent, amounting, to around $560,000,000 is made up of manufactures and merchandise. as no one is advocating any material reduction in the rates on agriculture or luxuries, it is only the comparatively small amount of about $560,000,000 of other imports that are really considered in any discussion of reducing tariff rates. while this amount, duty free, would be large enough seriously to depress many lines of business in our own country, it is of small importance when spread over the rest of the world. it is often stated that a reduction of tariff rates on industry would benefit agriculture. it would be interesting to know to what commodities it is thought this could be applied. everything the farmer uses in farming is already on the free list. nearly everything he sells is protected. it would seem to be obvious that it is better for tile country to have the farmer raise food to supply the domestic manufacturer than the foreign manufacturer. in one case our country would have only the farmer; in the other it would have the farmer and the manufacturer. assuming that europe would have more money if it sold us larger amounts of merchandise, it is not certain it would consume more food, or, if it did, that its purchases would be made in this country. undoubtedly it would resort to the cheapest market, which is by no means ours. the largest and best and most profitable market for the farmer in the world is our own domestic market. any great increase in manufactured imports means the closing of our own plants. nothing would be worse for agriculture. probably no one expects a material reduction in the rates on manufactures while maintaining the rates on agriculture. a material reduction in either would be disastrous to tile farmer. it would mean a general shrinkage of values, a deflation of prices, a reduction of wages, a general depression carrying our people down to the low standard of living in our competing countries. it is obvious that this would not improve but destroy our market for imports, which is best served by maintaining our present high purchasing power under which in the past five years imports have increased 63 per cent. farm loan system it is exceedingly important that the federal land and joint-stock land banks should furnish the best possible service for agriculture. certain joint-stock banks have fallen into improper and unsound practices, resulting in the indictment of the officials of three of them. more money has been provided for examinations, and at the instance of the treasury rules and regulations of the federal farm board have been revised. early last may three of its members resigned. their places were filled with men connected with the war finance corporation. eugene meyer being designated as farm loan commissioner. the new members have demonstrated their ability in the field of agricultural finance in the extensive operations of he war finance corporation. three joint-stock banks have gone into receivership. it is necessary to preserve the public confidence in this system in order to find a market for their bonds. a recent flotation was made at a record low rate of 4 per cent. careful supervision is absolutely necessary to protect the investor and enable these banks to exercise their chief function in serving agriculture. muscle shoals the last year has seen considerable changes in the problem of muscle shoals. development of other methods show that nitrates can probably be produced at less cost than by the use of hydroelectric power. extensive investigation made by the department of war indicates that the nitrate plants on this project are of little value for national defense and can probably be disposed of within two years. the oxidation part of the plants, however, should be retained indefinitely. this leaves this project mostly concerned with power. it should, nevertheless, continue to be dedicated to agriculture. it is probable that this desire can be best served by disposing of the plant and applying the revenues received from it to research for methods of more economical production of concentrated fertilizer and to demonstrations and other methods of stimulating its use on the farm. but in disposing of the property preference should be given to proposals to use all or part of it for nitrate production and fertilizer manufacturing. flood control for many years the federal government has been building a system of dikes along the mississippi river for protection against high water. during the past season the lower states were overcome by a most disastrous flood. many thousands of square miles were inundated a great many lives were lost, much livestock was drowned, and a very heavy destruction of property was inflicted upon the inhabitants. the american red cross at once went to the relief of the stricken communities. appeals for contributions have brought in over $17,000,000. the federal government has provided services, equipment, and supplies probably amounting to about $7,000,000 more. between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000 in addition have been provided by local railroads, the states, and their political units. credits have been arranged by the farm loan board, and three emergency finance corporations with a total capital of $3,000,000 have insured additional resources to the extent of $12,000,000. through these means the 700,000 people in the flooded areas have been adequately supported. provision has been made to care for those in need until after the 1st of january. the engineering corps of the army has contracted to close all breaks in the dike system before the next season of high water. a most thorough and elaborate survey of the whole situation has been made and embodied in a report with recommendations for future flood control, which will be presented to the congress. the carrying out of their plans will necessarily extend over a series of years. they will call for a raising and strengthening of the dike system with provision for emergency spillway's and improvements for the benefit of navigation. under the present law the land adjacent to the dikes has paid one-third of the cost of their construction. this has been a most extraordinary concession from the plan adopted in relation to irrigation, where the general rule has been that the land benefited should bear the entire expense. it is true, of course, that the troublesome waters do not originate on the land to be reclaimed, but it is also true that such waters have a right of way through that section of the country and the land there is charged with that easement. it is the land of this region that is to be benefited. to say that it is unable to bear any expense of reclamation is the same thing as saying that it is not worth reclaiming. because of expenses incurred and charges already held against this land, it seems probable that some revision will have to be made concerning the proportion of cost which it should bear. but it is extremely important that it should pay enough so that those requesting improvements will be charged with some responsibility for their cost, and the neighborhood where works are constructed have a pecuniary interest in preventing waste and extravagance and securing a wise and economical expenditure of public funds. it is necessary to look upon this emergency as a national disaster. it has been so treated from its inception. our whole people have provided with great generosity for its relief. most of the departments of the federal government have been engaged in the same effort. the governments of the afflicted areas, both state and municipal, can not be given too high praise for the courageous and helpful way in which they have come to the rescue of the people. if the sources directly chargeable can not meet the demand, the national government should not fail to provide generous relief. this, however, does not mean restoration. the government is not an insurer of its citizens against the hazard of the elements. we shall always have flood and drought, heat and cold, earthquake and wind, lightning and tidal wave, which are all too constant in their afflictions. the government does not undertake to reimburse its citizens for loss and damage incurred under such circumstances. it is chargeable, however, with the rebuilding of public works and the humanitarian duty of relieving its citizens from distress. the people in the flooded area and their representatives have approached this problem in the most generous and broad-minded way. they should be met with a like spirit on the part of the national government. this is all one country. the public needs of each part must be provided for by the public at large. no required relief should be refused. an adequate plan should be adopted to prevent a recurrence of this disaster in order that the people may restore to productivity and comfort their fields and their towns. legislation by this congress should be confined to our principal and most pressing problem, the lower mississippi, considering tributaries only so far as they materially affect the main flood problem. a definite federal program relating to our waterways was proposed when the last congress authorized a comprehensive survey of all the important streams of the country in order to provide for their improvement, including flood control, navigation, power, and irrigation. other legislation should wait pending a report on this survey. the recognized needs of the mississippi should not be made a vehicle for carrying other projects. all proposals for development should stand on their own merits. any other method would result in ill-advised conclusions, great waste of money, and instead of promoting would delay the orderly and certain utilization of our water resources. very recently several of the new england states have suffered somewhat similarly from heavy rainfall and high water. no reliable estimate of damage has yet been computed, but it is very large to private and public property. the red cross is generously undertaking what is needed for immediate relief, repair and reconstruction of houses, restocking of domestic animals, and food, clothing, and shelter. a considerable sum of money will be available through the regular channels in the department of agriculture for reconstruction of highways. it may be necessary to grant special aid for this purpose. complete reports of what is required will undoubtedly be available early in the session. inland navigation the congress in its last session authorized the general improvements necessary to provide the mississippi waterway system with better transportation. stabilization of the levels of the great lakes and their opening to the sea by an effective shipway remain to be considered. since the last session the board of engineers of the war department has made a report on the proposal for a canal through the state of new york, and the joint board of engineers, representing canada and the united states, has finished a report on the st. lawrence river. both of these boards conclude that the st. lawrence project is cheaper, affords a more expeditious method of placing western products in european markets, and will cost less to operate. the state department has requested the canadian government to negotiate treaties necessary to provide for this improvement. it will also be necessary to secure an agreement with canada to put in works necessary to prevent fluctuation in the levels of the great lakes. legislation is desirable for the construction of a dam at boulder canyon on the colorado river, primarily as a method of flood control and irrigation. a secondary result would be a considerable power development and a source of domestic water supply for southern california. flood control is clearly a national problem, and water supply is a government problem, but every other possibility should be exhausted before the federal government becomes engaged in the power business. the states which are interested ought to reach mutual agreement. this project is in reality their work. if they wish the federal government to undertake it, they should not hesitate to make the necessary concessions to each other. this subject is fully discussed in the annual report of the secretary of the interior. the columbia river basin project is being studied and will be one to be considered at some future time. the inland waterways corporation is proving successful and especially beneficial to agriculture. a survey is being made to determine its future needs. it has never been contemplated that if inland rivers were opened to navigation it would then be necessary for the federal government to provide the navigation. such a request is very nearly the equivalent of a declaration that their navigation is not profitable, that the commodities which they are to carry can be taken at a cheaper rate by some other method, in which case the hundreds of millions of dollars proposed to be expended for opening rivers to navigation would be not only wasted, but would entail further constant expenditures to carry the commodities of private persons for less than cost. the policy is well established that the government should open public highways on land and on water, but for use of the public in their private capacity. it has put on some demonstration barge lines, but always with the expectation that if they prove profitable they would pass into private hands and if they do not prove profitable they will be withdrawn. the problems of transportation over inland waterways should be taken up by private enterprise, so that the public will have the advantage of competition in service. it is expected that some of our lines can be sold, some more demonstration work done, and that with the completion of the ohio project a policy of private operation can be fully developed. prohibition after more than two generations of constant debate, our country adopted a system of national prohibition under all the solemnities involved in an amendment to the federal constitution. in obedience to this mandate the congress and the states, with one or two notable exceptions, have passed required laws for its administration and enforcement. this imposes upon the citizenship of the country, and especially on all public officers, not only the duty to enforce, but the obligation to observe the sanctions of this constitutional provision and its resulting laws. if this condition could be secured, all question concerning prohibition would cease. the federal government is making every effort to accomplish these results through careful organization, large appropriations, and administrative effort. smuggling has been greatly cut down, the larger sources of supply for illegal sale have been checked, and by means of injunction and criminal prosecution the process of enforcement is being applied. the same vigilance on the part of local governments would render these efforts much more successful. the federal authorities propose to discharge their obligation for enforcement to the full extent of their ability. the negro history does not anywhere record so much progress made in the same length of time as that which has been accomplished by the negro race in the united states since the emancipation proclamation. they have come up from slavery to be prominent in education, the professions, art, science, agriculture, banking, and commerce. it is estimated that 50,000 of them are on the government pay rolls, drawing about $50,000,000 each year. they have been the recipients of presidential appointments and their professional ability has arisen to a sufficiently high plane so that they have been intrusted with the entire management and control of the great veterans hospital at tuskegee, where their conduct has taken high rank. they have shown that they have been worthy of all the encouragement which they have received. nevertheless, they are too often subjected to thoughtless and inconsiderate treatment, unworthy alike of the white or colored races. they have especially been made the target of the foul crime of lynching. for several years these acts of unlawful violence had been diminishing. in the last year they have shown an increase. every principle of order and law and liberty is opposed to this crime. the congress should enact any legislation it can under the constitution to provide for its elimination. american indian the condition of the american indian has much improved in recent years. full citizenship was bestowed upon them on june 2, 1924, and appropriations for their care and advancement have been increased. still there remains much to be done. notable increases in appropriations for the several major functions performed by the department of the interior on behalf of the indians have marked the last five years. in that time, successive annual increases in appropriations for their education total $1,804,325; for medical care, $578,000; and for industrial advancement, $205,000; or $2,582,325 more than would have been spent in the same period on the basis of appropriations for 1923 and the preceding years. the needs along health, educational, industrial and social lines however, are great, and the budget estimates for 1929 include still further increases for indian administration. to advance the time when the indians may become self-sustaining, it is my belief that the federal government should continue to improve the facilities for their care, and as rapidly as possible turn its responsibility over to the states. coal legislation authorizing a system of fuel administration and the appointment by the president of a board of mediation and conciliation in case of actual or threatened interruption of production is needed. the miners themselves are now seeking information and action from the government, which could readily be secured through such a board. it is believed that a thorough investigation and reconsideration of this proposed policy by the congress will demonstrate that this recommendation is sound and should be adopted. petroleum conservation the national government is undertaking to join in the formation of a cooperative committee of lawyers, engineers, and public officers, to consider what legislation by the states or by the congress can be adopted for the preservation and conservation of our supply of petroleum. this has come to be one of the main dependencies for transportation and power so necessary to our agricultural and industrial life. it is expected the report of this committee will be available for later congressional action. meantime, the requirement that the secretary of the interior should make certain leases of land belonging to the osage indians, in accordance with the act of march 3, 1921, should be repealed. the authority to lease should be discretionary, in order that the property of the indians way not be wasted and the public suffer a future lack of supply. alien property under treaty the property held by the alien property custodian was to be retained until suitable provision had been made for the satisfaction of american claims. while still protecting the american claimants, in order to afford every possible accommodation to the nationals of the countries whose property was held, the congress has made liberal provision for the return of a larger part of the property. all trusts under $10,000 were returned in full, and partial returns were made on the others. the total returned was approximately $350,000,000. there is still retained, however, about $250,000,000. the mixed claims commission has made such progress in the adjudication of claims that legislation can now be enacted providing for the return of the property, which should be done under conditions which will protect our government and our claimants. such a measure will be proposed, and i recommend its enactment. railroad consolidation in order to increase the efficiency of transportation and decrease its cost to the shipper, railroad consolidation must be secured. legislation is needed to simplify the necessary procedure to secure such agreements and arrangements for consolidation, always under the control and with the approval of the interstate commerce commission. pending this, no adequate or permanent reorganization can be made of the freight-rate structure. meantime, both agriculture and industry are compelled to wait for needed relief. this is purely a business question, which should be stripped of all local and partisan bias and decided on broad principles and its merits in order to promote the public welfare. a large amount of new construction and equipment, which will furnish employment for labor and markets for commodities of both factory and farm, wait on the decision of this important question. delay is holding back the progress of our country. many of the same arguments are applicable to the consolidation of the washington traction companies. veterans the care which this country has lavished on its veterans is known of all men. the yearly outlay for this purpose is about $750,000,000, or about the cost of running the federal government, outside of the post office department, before the world war. the congress will have before it recommendations of the american legion, the veterans of foreign wars, and other like organizations, which should receive candid consideration. we should continue to foster our system of compensation and rehabilitation, and provide hospitals and insurance. the magnitude of the undertaking is already so large that all requests calling for further expenditure should have the most searching scrutiny. our present system of pensions is already sufficiently liberal. it was increased by the last congress for civil and spanish war veterans and widows and for some dependents. it has been suggested that the various governmental agencies now dealing with veterans' relief be consolidated. this would bring many advantages. it is recommended that the proper committees of the congress make a thorough survey of this subject, in order to determine if legislation to secure such consolidation is desirable. education for many years it has been the policy of the federal government to encourage and foster the cause of education. large sums of money are annually appropriated to carry on vocational training. many millions go into agricultural schools. the general subject is under the immediate direction of a commissioner of education. while this subject is strictly a state and local function, it should continue to have the encouragement of the national government. i am still of the opinion that much good could be accomplished through the establishment of a department of education and relief, into which would be gathered all of these functions under one directing member of the cabinet. department of labor industrial relations have never been more peaceful. in recent months they have suffered from only one serious controversy. in all others difficulties have been adjusted, both management and labor wishing to settle controversies by friendly agreement rather than by compulsion. the welfare of women and children is being especially guarded by our department of labor. its children's bureau is in cooperation with 26 state boards and 80 juvenile courts. through its bureau of immigration it bas been found that medical examination abroad has saved prospective immigrants from much hardship. some further legislation to provide for reuniting families when either the husband or the wife is in this country, and granting more freedom for the migration of the north american indian tribes is desirable. the united states employment service has enabled about 2,000,000 men and women to gain paying positions in the last fiscal year. particular attention has been given to assisting men past middle life and in providing field labor for harvesting agricultural crops. this has been made possible in part through the service of the federal board for vocational education, which is cooperating with the states in a program to increase the technical knowledge and skill of the wage earner. public buildings construction is under way in the country and ground has been broken for carrying out a public-building program for washington. we have reached a time when not only the conveniences but the architectural beauty of the public buildings of the capital city should be given much attention. it will be necessary to purchase further land and provide the required continuing appropriations. historical celebrations provision is being made to commemorate the two hundredth anniversary of the birth of george washington. suggestion has been made for the construction of a memorial road leading from the capital to mount vernon, which may well have the consideration of the congress, and the commission intrusted with preparations for the celebration will undoubtedly recommend publication of the complete writings of washington and a series of writings by different authors relating to him. february 25, 1929. is the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the capture of fort sackville, at vincennes, in the state of indiana. this eventually brought into the union what was known as the northwest territory, embracing the region north of the ohio river between the alleghenies and the mississippi river. this expedition was led by george rogers clark. his heroic character and the importance of his victory are too little known and understood. they gave us not only this northwest territory but by means of that the prospect of reaching the pacific. the state of indiana is proposing to dedicate the site of fort sackville as a national shrine. the federal government may well make some provision for the erection under its own management of a fitting memorial at that point. foreign relations it is the policy of the united states to promote peace. we are a peaceful people and committed to the settling of disputes by amicable adjustment rather than by force. we have believed that peace can best be secured by a faithful observance on our part of the principles of international law, accompanied by patience and conciliation, and requiring of others a like treatment for ourselves. we have lately had some difference with mexico relative to the injuries inflicted upon our nationals and their property within that country. a firm adherence to our rights and a scrupulous respect for the sovereignty of mexico, both in accordance with the law of nations, coupled with patience and forbearance, it is hoped will resolve all our differences without interfering with the friendly relationship between the two governments. we have been compelled to send naval and marine forces to china to protect the lives and property of our citizens. fortunately their simple presence there has been sufficient to prevent any material loss of life. but there has been considerable loss of property. that unhappy country is torn by factions and revolutions which bid fair to last for an indefinite period. meanwhile we are protecting our citizens and stand ready to cooperate with any government which may emerge in promoting the welfare of the people of china. they have always had our friendship, and they should especially merit our consideration in these days of their distraction and distress. we were confronted by similar condition on a small scale in nicaragua. our marine and naval forces protected our citizens and their property and prevented a heavy sacrifice of life and the destruction of that country by a reversion to a state of revolution. henry l. stimson, former secretary of war, was sent there to cooperate with our diplomatic and military officers in effecting a settlement between the contending parties. this was done on the assurance that we would cooperate in restoring a state of peace where our rights would be protected by giving our assistance in the conduct of the next presidential election, which occurs in a few months. with this assurance the population returned to their peacetime pursuits, with the exception of some small roving bands of outlaws. in general, our relations with other countries can be said to have improved within the year. while having a due regard for our own affairs, the protection of our own rights, and the advancement of our own people, we can afford to be liberal toward others. our example has become of great importance in the world. it is recognized that we are independent, detached, and can and do take a disinterested position in relation to international affairs. our charity embraces the earth. our trade is far flung. our financial favors are widespread. those who are peaceful and law-abiding realize that not only have they nothing to fear from us, but that they can rely on our moral support. proposals for promoting the peace of the world will have careful consideration. but we are not a people who are always seeking for a sign. we know that peace comes from honesty and fair dealing, from moderation, and a generous regard for the rights of others. the heart of the nation is more important than treaties. a spirit of generous consideration is a more certain defense than great armaments. we should continue to promote peace by our example, and fortify it by such international covenants against war as we are permitted under our constitution to make. american progress our country has made much progress. but it has taken, and will continue to take, much effort. competition will be keen, the temptation to selfishness and arrogance will be severe, the provocations to deal harshly with weaker peoples will be many. all of these are embraced in the opportunity for true greatness. they will be overbalanced by cooperation by generosity, and a spirit of neighborly kindness. the forces of the universe are taking humanity in that direction. in doing good, in walking humbly, in sustaining its own people in ministering to other nations, america will work out its own mighty destiny.\"\n",
      " 'to the congress of the united states:no congress of the united states ever assembled, on surveying the state of the union, has met with a more pleasing prospect than that which appears at the present time. in the domestic field there is tranquility and contentment, harmonious relations between management and wage earner, freedom from industrial strife, and the highest record of years of prosperity. in the foreign field there is peace, the good will which comes from mutual understanding, and the knowledge that the problems which a short time ago appeared so ominous are yielding to the touch of manifest friendship. the great wealth created by our enterprise and industry, and saved by our economy, has had the widest distribution among our own people, and has gone out in a steady stream to serve the charity and the business of the world. the requirements of existence have passed beyond the standard of necessity into the region of luxury. enlarging production is consumed by an increasing demand at home and an expanding commerce abroad. the country can regard the present with satisfaction and anticipate the future with optimism.  the main source of these unexampled blessings lies in the integrity and character of the american people. they have had great faith, which they have supplemented with mighty works. they have been able to put trust in each other and trust in their government. their candor in dealing with foreign governments has commanded respect and confidence. yet these remarkable powers would have been exerted almost in vain without the constant cooperation and careful administration of the federal government.  we have been coming into a period which may be fairly characterized as a conservation of our national resources. wastefulness in public business and private enterprise has been displaced by constructive economy. this has been accomplished by bringing our domestic and foreign relations more and more under a reign of law. a rule of force has been giving way to a rule of reason. we have substituted for the vicious circle of increasing expenditures, increasing tax rates, and diminishing profits the charmed circle of diminishing expenditures, diminishing tax rates, and increasing profits.  four times we have made a drastic revision of our internal revenue system, abolishing many taxes and substantially reducing almost all others. each time the resulting stimulation to business has so increased taxable incomes and profits that a surplus has been produced. one-third of the national debt has been paid, while much of the other two-thirds has been refunded at lower rates, and these savings of interest and constant economies have enabled us to repeat the satisfying process of more tax reductions. under this sound and healthful encouragement the national income has increased nearly 50 per cent, until it is estimated to stand well over $90,000,000,000. it has been a method which has performed the secining miracle of leaving a much greater percentage of earnings in the hands of the taxpayers \\'with scarcely any diminution of the government revenue. that is constructive economy in the highest degree. it is the corner stone of prosperity. it should not fail to be continued.  this action began by the application of economy to public expenditure. if it is to be permanent, it must be made so by the repeated application of economy. there is no surplus on which to base further tax revision at this time. last june the estimates showed a threatened deficit for the current fiscal year of $94,000,000. under my direction the departments began saving all they could out of their present appropriations. the last tax reduction brought \\'an encouraging improvement in business, beginning early in october, which will also increase our revenue. the combination of economy and good times now indicates a surplus of about $37,000,000. this is a margin of less than 1 percent of our expenditures and makes it obvious that the treasury is in no condition to undertake increases in ditures to be made before june 30. it is necessary therefor\"stuing the present session to refrain from new appropriations for immediate outlay, or if such are absolutely required to provide for them by new revenue; otherwise, we shall reach the end of the year with the unthinkable result of an unbalanced budget. for the first time during my term of office we face that contingency. i am certain that the congress would not pass and i should not feel warranted in approving legislation which would involve us in that financial disgrace.  on the whole the finances of the government are most satisfactory. last year the national debt was reduced about $906,000,000. the refunding and retirement of the second and third liberty loans have just been brought to a successful conclusion, which will save about $75,000,0w a year in interest. the unpaid balance has been arranged  in maturities convenient for carrying out our permanent debt-paying program.  the enormous savings made have not been at the expense of any legitimate public need. the government plant has been kept up and many improvements are tinder way, while its service is fully manned and the general efficiency of operation has increased. we have been enabled to undertake many new enterprises. among these are the adjusted compensation of the veterans of the world war, which is costing us $112,000,000 a year; amortizing our liability to the civil service retirement funds, $20,000,000; increase of expenditures for rivers and harbors including flood control, $43,000,000; public buildings, $47,000,000. in 1928 we spent $50,000,000 in the adjustment of war claims and alien property. these are examples of a large list of items.  foreign reiations  when we turn from our domestic affairs to our foreign relations, we likewise perceive peace and progress. the sixth international conference of american states was held at habana last winter. it contributed to a better understanding and cooperation among the nations\\'. eleven important conventions were signed and 71 resolutions passed. pursuant to the plan then adopted, this government has invited the other 20 nations of this hemisphere to it conference on conciliation and arbitration, which meets in washington on december 10. all the nations have accepted and the expectation is justified that important progress will be made in methods for resolving international differences by means of arbitration.  during the year we have signed 11 new arbitration treaties, and 22 more are tinder negotiation.  nicaragua  when a destructive and bloody revolution lately broke out in nicaragua, at the earnest and repeated entreaties of its government i dispatched our marine forces there to protect the lives and interests of our citizens. to compose the contending parties, i sent there col. henry l. stimson, former secretary of war and now governor general of the philippine islands, who secured an agreement that warfare should cease, a national election should be held and peace should be restored. both parties conscientiously carried out this agreement, with the exception of a few bandits who later mostly surrendered or left the country. president diaz appointed brig. gen. frank r. mccoy, united states army, president of the election board, which included also one member of each political party.  a free and fair election has been held and has worked out so successfully that both parties have joined in requesting like cooperation from this country at the election four years hence, to which i have refrained from making any commitments, although our country must be gratified at such an exhibition of success and appreciation  nicaragua is regaining its prosperity and has taken a long step in the direction of peaceful self-government.  tacna-arica  the long-standing differences between chile and peru have been sufficiently composed so that diplomatic relations have been resumed by the exchange of ambassadors. negotiations are hopefully proceeding as this is written for the final adjustment of the differences over their disputed territory.  mexico  our relations with mexico are on a more satisfactory basis than at any time since their revolution. many misunderstandings have been resolved and the most frank and friendly negotiations promise a final adjustment of all unsettled questions. it is exceedingly gratifying that ambassador morrow has been able to bring our two neighboring countries, which have so many interests in common, to a position of confidence in each other and of respect for mutual sovereign rights.  china  the situation in china which a few months ago was so threatening as to call for the dispatch of a large additional force has, been much composed. the nationalist government has established itself over the country and promulgated a new organic law announcing a program intended to promote the political and economic welfare of the people. we have recognized this government, encouraged its progress, and have negotiated a treaty restoring to china complete tariff autonomy and guaranteeing our citizens against discriminations. our trade in that quarter is increasing and our forces are being reduced.  greek and austrian debts  pending before the congress is a recommendation for the settlement of the greek debt and the austrian debt. both of these are comparatively small and our country can afford to be generous. the rehabilitation of these countries await& their settlement. there would also be advantages to our trade. we could scarcely afford to be the only nation that refuses the relief which austria seeks. the congress has already granted austria a long-time moratorium, which it is understood will be waived and immediate payments begun on her debt on the same basis which we have extended to other countries.  peace treaty  one of the most important treaties ever laid before the senate of the united states will be that which the 15 nations recently signed at paris, and to which 44 other nations have declared their intention to adhere, renouncing war as a national policy and agreeing to resort only to peaceful means for the adjustment of international differences. it is the most solemn declaration against war, the most positive adherence to peace, that it is possible\\' for sovereign nations to  make. it does not supersede our inalienable sovereign right and duty of national defense or undertake to commit us before the event to any mode of action which the congress might decide to be wise. it ever the treaty should be broken. but it is a new standard in the world around which can rally the informed and enlightened opinion of nations to prevent their governments from beii4\\'forced into hostile action by the temporary outbreak of international animosities. the observance of this covenant, so simple and so straightforward, promises more for the peace of the world than any other agreement ever negotiated among the nations.  national defense  the first duty of our government to its own citizens and foreigners within its borders is the preservation of order. unless and until that duty is met a government is not even eligible for recognition among the family of nations. the advancement of world civilization likewise is dependent upon that order among the people of different countries which we term peace. to insure our citizens against the infringement of their legal rights at home and abroad, to preserve order, liberty, and peace by making the law supreme, we have an army and a navy.  both of these are organized for defensive purposes. our army could not be much reduced, but does not need to be increased. such new housing and repairs as are necessary are tinder way and the 6-year program in aviation is being put into effect in both branches of our service.  our navy, according to generally accepted standards, is deficient in cruisers. we have 10 comparatively new vessels, 22 that are old, and 8 to be built. it is evident that renewals and replacements must be provided. this matter was thoroughly canvassed at the last session of the congress and does not need restatement. the bill before the senate with the elimination of the time clause should be passed. we have no intention of competing with any other country. this building program is for necessary replacements and to meet our needs for defense.  the cost of national defense is stupendous. it has increased $118,000,000 in the past four years. the estimated expenditure for 1930 is $668,000,000. while this is made up of many items it is, after all, mostly dependent upon numbers. our defensive needs do not can for any increase in the number of men in the army or the navy. we have reached the limit of what we ought to expend for that purpose.  i wish to repeat again for the benefit of the timid and the suspicious that this country is neither militaristic nor imperialistic. many people at home and abroad, who constantly make this charge, are the same ones who are even more solicitous to have us extend assistance to foreign countries. when such assistance is granted, the inevitable result is that we have foreign interests. for us to refuse the customary support and protection of such interests would be in derogation of the sovereignty of this nation. our largest foreign interests are in the british empire, france, and italy. because we are constantly solicitous for those interests, i doubt if anyone would suppose that those countries feel we harbor toward them any militaristic or imperialistic design. as for smaller countries, we certainly do not want any of them. we are more anxious than they are to have their sovereignty respected. our entire influence is in behalf of their independence. cuba stands as a witness to our adherence to this principle.  the position of this government relative to the limitation of armaments, the results already secured, and the developments up to the present time are so well known to the congress that they do not require any restatement.  veterans  the magnitude of our present system of veterans\\' relief is without precedent, and the results have been far-reaching. for years a service pension has been granted to the grand army and lately to the survivors of the spanish-american war. at the time we entered the world war however, congress departed from the usual pension system followed by our gove2rnment. eleven years have elapsed since our laws were first enacted, initiating a system of compensation, rehabilitation, hospitalization, and insurance for the disabled of the world war and their dependents. the administration \\'of all the laws concerning relief has been a difficult task, but it can safely be stated that these measures have omitted nothing in their desire to deal generously and humanely. we should continue to foster this system and provide all the facilities necessary for adequate care. it is the conception of our government that the pension roll is an honor roll. it should include all those who are justly entitled to its benefits, but exclude all others.  annual expenditures for all forms of veterans\\' relief now approximate $765,000,000, and are increasing from year to year. it is doubtful if the peak of expenditures will be reached even under present legislation for sonic time yet to come. further amendments to the existing law will be suggested by the american legion, the veterans of foreign wars of the united states, the disabled american veterans of the world war, and other like organizations, and it may be necessary for administrative purposes, or in order to remove some existing inequalities in the present law, to make further changes. i am sure that such recommendations its may be submitted to the congress will receive your careful consideration. but because of the vast expenditure now being made, each year, with every assurance that it will increase, and because of the great liberality of the existing law, the proposal of any additional legislation dealing with this subject should receive most searching scrutiny from the congress.  you are familiar with the suggestion that the various public agencies now dealing with matters of veterans\\' relief be consolidated in one government department. some advantages to this plan seem apparent, especially in the simplification of administration find in the opportunity of bringing about a greater uniformity in the application of veterans\\' relief. i recommend that a survey be made by the proper committees of congress dealing with this subject, in order to determine whether legislation to secure this consolidation is desirable.  agriculture  the past year has been marked by notable though not uniform improvement in agriculture. the general purchasing power of farm  products and the volume of production have advanced. this means not only further progress, in overcoming the price disparity into which agriculture was plunged in 1920-21, but also increased efficiency on the part of farmers and a well-grounded confidence in the future of agriculture.  the livestock industry has attained the best balance for many years and is prospering conspicuously. dairymen, beef producers, an poultrymen are receiving substantially larger returns than last year. cotton, although lower in price than at this time last year, was produced in greater volume and the prospect for cotton incomes is favorable. but progress is never uniform in a vast and highly diversified agriculture or industry. cash grains, hay, tobacco, and potatoes will bring somewhat smaller returns this year than last. present indications are, however, that the gross farm income will be somewhat larger than in the crop year 1927-28, when the total was $12,253,000,000. the corresponding figure for 1926-27 was $12,127,000,000, and in 1925-26, $12,670,000,000. still better results would have been secured this year had there not been an undue increase in the production of certain crops. this is particularly true of potatoes, which have sold at an unremunerative price, or at a loss, as a direct result of overexpansion of acreage.  the present status of agriculture, although greatly improved over that of a few years ago, bespeaks the need of further improvemen4 which calls for determined effort of farmers themselves, encouraged and assisted by wise public policy. the government has been, and must continue to be, alive to the needs of agriculture.  in the past eight years more constructive legislation of direct benefit to agriculture has been adopted than during any other period. the department of agriculture has been broadened and reorganized to insure greater efficiency. the department is laying greater stress on the economic and business phases of agriculture. it is lending every possible assistance to cooperative marketing associations. regulatory and research work have been segregated in order that each field may be served more effectively.  i can not too strongly commend, in the field of fact finding, the research work of the department of agriculture and the state experiment stations. the department now receives annually $4,000,000 more for research than in 1921. in addition, the funds paid to the states for experimentation purposes under the purnell act constitute an annual increase in federal payments to state agricultural experiment stations of $2,400,000 over the amount appropriated in 1921. the program of support for research may wisely be continued and expanded. since 1921 we have appropriated nearly an additional $2,000,000 for extension work, and this sum is to be increased next year under authorization by the capper-ketcham act.  the surplus problem  while these developments in fundamental research, regulation, and dissemination of agricultural information are of distinct hell) to agriculture, additional effort is needed. the surplus problem demands attention. as emphasized in my last message, the government should assume no responsibility in normal times for crop surplus clearly due to overextended acreage. the government should,  however, provide reliable information as a guide to private effort; and in this connection fundamental research on prospective supply and demand, as a guide to production and marketing, should be encouraged. expenditure of public funds to bring in more new land should have most searching scrutiny, so long as our farmers face unsatisfactory prices for crops and livestock produced on land already under cultivation.  every proper effort should be made to put land to uses for which it is adapted. the reforestation of land best suited for timber production is progressing and should be encouraged, and to this end the forest taxation inquiry was instituted to afford a practical guide for public policy. improvement bas been made in grazing regulation in the forest reserves, not only to protect the ranges, but to preserve the soil from erosion. similar action is urgently needed to protect other public lands which are now overgrazed and rapidly eroding.  temporary expedients, though sometimes capable of appeasing the demands of the moment, can not permanently solve the surplus problem and might seriously aggravate it. hence putting the government directly into business, subsidies, and price fixing, and the alluring promises of political action as a substitute for private initiative, should be avoided.  the government should aid in promoting orderly marketing and in handling surpluses clearly due to weather and seasonal conditions. as a beginning there should be created a federal farm board consisting of able and experienced men empowered to advise producers\\' associations in establishing central agencies or stabilization corporations to handle surpluses, to seek wore economical means of merchandising, and to aid the producer in securing returns according to the a14 of his product. a revolving loan fund should be provided for the necessary financing until these agencies shall have developed means of financing their operations through regularly constituted credit institutions. such a bill should carry authority for raising the money, by loans or otherwise, necessary to meet the expense, as the treasury has no surplus.  agriculture has lagged behind industry in achieving that unity of effort which modern economic life demands. the cooperative movement, which is gradually building the needed organization, is in harmony with public interest and therefore merits public encouragement.  the responsibility of the states  important phases of public policy related to agriculture lie within the sphere of the states. while successive reductions in federal taxes have relieved most farmers of direct taxes to the national government, state and local levies have become a serious burden. this problem needs immediate and thorough study with a view to correction at the earliest possible moment. it will have to be made largely by the states themselves.  commerce  it is desirable that the government continue its helpful attitude toward american business. the activities of the department of commerce have contributed largely to the present satisfactory posi  tion in our international trade, which has reached about $9,000,000,000 annually. there should be no slackening of effort in that direction. it is also important that the department\\'s assistance to domestic commerce be continued. there is probably no way in which the government can aid sound economic progress more effectively than by cooperation with our business men to reduce wastes in distribution.  commercial aeronautics  continued progress in civil aviation is most gratifying. demands for airplanes and motors have taxed both the industry and the licensing and inspection service of the department of commerce to their capacity. while the compulsory licensing provisions of the air commerce act apply only to equipment and personnel engaged in interstate and foreign commerce, a federal license may be procured by anyone possessing the necessary qualifications. state legislation, local airport regulations, and insurance requirements make such a license practically indispensable. this results in uniformity of regulation and increased safety in operation, which are essential to aeronautical development. over 17,000 young men and women have now applied for federal air pilot\\'s licenses or permits. more than 80 per cent of them applied during the past year.  our national airway system exceeds 14,000 miles in length and has 7,500 miles lighted for night operations. provision has been made for lighting 4,000 miles more during the current fiscal year and equipping an equal mileage with radio facilities. three-quarters of our people are now served by these routes. with the rapid growth of air mail, express, and passenger service, this new transportation medium is daily becoming a more important factor in commerce. it is noteworthy that this development has taken place without governmental subsidies. commercial passenger flights operating on schedule have reached 13,000 miles per day.  during the next fortnight this nation will entertain the nations of the world in a celebration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the first successful airplane flight. the credit for this epoch-making achievement belongs to a citizen of our own country, orville wright.  cuban parcel post  i desire to repeat my recommendation of an earlier message, that congress enact the legislation necessary to make permanent the parcel post convention with cuba, both as a facility to american commerce and as a measure of equity to cuba in the one class of goods which that country can send here by parcel post without detriment to our own trade.  \"maine\" battleship memorial  when i attended the pan american conference at habana, the president of cuba showed me a marble statue made from the original memorial that was overturned by a storm after it was erected on the cuban shore to the memory of the men who perished in the destruction of the battleship maine. as a testimony of friendship and appreciation of the cuban government and people lie most gen  erously offered to present this to the. united states, and i assured him of my pleasure in accepting it. there is no location in the white house for placing so large and heavy a structure, and i therefore urge the congress to provide by law for some locality where it can be set up.  railroads  in previous annual messages i have suggested the enactment of laws to promote railroad consolidation with the view of increasing the efficiency of transportation and lessening its cost to the public. while, consolidations can and should be made under the present law until it is changed, vet the provisions of the act of 1920 have not been found fully adequate to meet the needs of other methods of consolidation. amendments designed to remedy these defects have been considered at length by the respective committees of congress and a bill was reported out late in the last session which i understand has the approval in principle of the interstate commerce commission. it is to be hoped that this legislation may be enacted at an early date.  experience has shown that the interstate commerce law requires definition and clarification in several other respects, some of which have been pointed out by the interstate commerce commission in its annual reports to the congress. it will promote the public interest to have the congress give early consideration to the recommendations there made.  merchant marine  the cost of maintaining the united states government merchant fleet has been steadily reduced. we have established american flag lines in foreign trade where they had never before existed as a means of promoting commerce and as a naval auxiliary. there have been sold to private american capital for operation within the past few years 14 of these lines, which, under the encouragement of the recent legislation passed by the congress, give promise of continued successful operation. additional legislation from time to time may be necessary to promote future advancement under private control.  through the cooperation of the post office department and the shipping board long-term contracts are being made with american steamship lines for carrying mail, which already promise the construction of 15 to 20 new vessels and the gradual reestablishment of the american merchant marine as a private enterprise. no action of the national government has been so beneficial to our shipping. the cost is being absorbed to a considerable extent by the disposal of unprofitable lines operated by the shipping board, for which the new law has made a market. meanwhile it should be our policy to maintain necessary strategic lines under the government operation until they can be transferred to private capital.  inter-american highway  in my message last year i expressed the view that we should lend our encouragement for more good roads to all the principal points on this hemisphere south of the rio grande. my view has not changed.  the pan american union has recently indorsed it. in some of the countries to the south a great deal of progress is being made in road building. in, others engineering features are often exacting and financing difficult. as those countries enter upon programs for road building we should be ready to contribute from our abundant experience to make their task easier of accomplishment. i prefer not to go into civil life to accomplish this end. we already furnish military and naval advisors, and following this precedent we could draw competent men from these same sources and from the department of agriculture.  we should provide our southern neighbors, if they request it, with such engineer advisors for the construction of roads and bridges. private t1literests should look with favor upon all reasonable loans sought by these countries to open main lines of travel. such assistance should be given especially to any project for a highway designed to connect all the countries on this hemisphere and thus facilitate, intercourse and closer relations among, them.  air mail service  the friendly relations and the extensive, commercial intercourse with the western hemisphere to the south of us are being further cemented by the establishment and extension of air-mail routes. we shall soon have one from key west, fla., over cuba, haiti, and santo domingo to san juan, p. r., where it will connect with another route to trinidad. there will be another route from key west to the canal zone, where connection will be made with a route across the northern coast of south america to paramaribo. this will give us a circle around the caribbean under our own control.. additional connections will be made at colon with a route running down the west coast of south america as far as conception, chile, and with the french air mail at paramaribo running down the eastern coast of south america. \\'the air service already spans our continent, with laterals running to mexico and canada, and covering a daily flight of over 28,000 miles, with an average cargo of 15 000 pounds.  waterways  our river and harbor improvements are proceeding with vigor. in the past few years ave have increased the appropriation for this regular work $28,000,000, besides what. is to be expended on flood control. the total appropriation for this year was over $91,000,000. the ohio river is almost ready for opening; work on the missouri and other rivers is under way. in accordance with the mississippi flood law army engineers are making investigations and surveys on other streams throughout the country with a view to flood control, navigation, waterpower, and irrigation. our bar(re lines are being operated under generous appropriations, and negotiations are developing relative to the st. lawrence waterway. to secure the largest benefits from all these waterways joint rates must be established with the railroads, preferably by agreement, but otherwise as a result of congressional action.  we have recently passed several river and harbor bills. the work ordered by the congress not, yet completed, will cost about $243,  000,000, besides the hundreds of millions to be spent on the mississippi flood way. until we can see our way out of this expense no further river and harbor legislation should be passed, as expenditures to put it into effect would be four or five years away.  irrigation of arid lands  for many years the federal government has been committed to the wise policy of reclamation and irrigation. while it has met with some failures due to unwise selection of projects and lack of thorough soil surveys, so that they could not be placed on a sound business basis, on the whole the service has been of such incalculable benefit in so many states that no one would advocate its abandonment. the program to which we are already committed, providing for the construction of new projects authorized by congress and the completion of old projects, will tax the resources of the reclamation fund over a period of years. the high cost of improving and equipping farms adds to the difficulty of securing settlers for vacant farms on federal projects.  readjustments authorized by the reclamation relief act of may 25, 1926, have given more favorable terms of repayment to settlers. these new financial arrangements and the general prosperity on irrigation projects have resulted in increased collections by the department of the interior of charges due the reclamation fund. nevertheless, the demand for still smaller yearly payments on some projects continues. these conditions should have consideration in connection with any proposed new projects.  colorado river  for several years the congress has considered the erection of a dam on the colorado river for flood-control, irrigation, and domestic water purposes, all of which ma properly be considered as government functions. there would be an incidental creation of water power which could be used for generating electricity. as private enterprise can very well fill this field, there is no need for the government to go into it. it is unfortunate that the states interested in this water have been unable to agree among themselves. nevertheless, any legislation should give every possible safeguard to the present and prospective rights of each of them.  the congress will have before it, the detailed report of a special board appointed to consider the engineering and economic feasibility of this project. from the short summary which i have seen of it, 11 judge they consider the engineering problems can be met at somewhat increased cost over previous estimates. they prefer the black canyon site. on the economic features they are not so clear and appear to base their conclusions on many conditions which can not be established with certainty. so far as i can judge, however, from the summary, their conclusions appear sufficiently favorable, so that i feel warranted in recommending a measure which will protect the rights of the states, discharge the necessary government functions, and leave the electrical field to private. enterprise.  muscle shoals  the development of other methods of producing nitrates will probably render this plant less important for that purpose than formerly. but we have it, and i am told it still provides a practical method of making nitrates for national defense and farm fertilizers. by dividing the property into its two component parts of power and nitrate plants it would be possible to dispose of the power, reserving the right to any concern that wished to make nitrates to use any power that might be needed for that purpose. such a disposition of the power plant can be made that will return in rental about $2,000,000 per year. if the congress would giant the secretary of war authority to lease the nitrate plant on such terms as would insure the largest production of nitrates, the entire property could begin to  function. such a division, i am aware, has never seemed to appeal to the congress. i should also gladly approve a bill granting authority to lease the entire property for the production of nitrates.  i wish to avoid building another, (lam at public expense. future operators should provide for that themselves. but if they were to be required to repay the cost of such dam with tile prevailing commercial rates for interest, this difficulty will be considerably lessened. nor do i think this property should be made a vehicle for putting the united states government indiscriminately into the private and retail field of power distribution and nitrate sales.  conservation  the practical application of economy to the resources of the country calls for conservation. this does not mean that every resource should not be developed to its full degree, but it means that none of them should be wasted. we have a conservation board working on our oil problem. this is of the utmost importance to the future well-being of our people in this age of oil-burning engines and tile general application of gasoline to transportation. the secretary of the interior should not be compelled to lease oil lands of the osage indians when the market is depressed and the future supply is in jeopardy.  while the area of lands remaining in public ownership is small, compared with the vast area in private ownership, the natural resources of those in public ownership are of immense present and future value. this is particularly trite as to minerals and water power. the proper bureaus have been classifying these resources to the end that they may be conserved. appropriate estimates are being submitted, in the budget, for the further prosecution of this important work.  immigration  the policy of restrictive immigration should be maintained. authority should be granted the secretary of labor to give immediate preference to learned professions and experts essential to new industries. the reuniting of families should be expedited. our immigration and naturalization laws might well be codified.  wage earner  in its economic life our country has rejected the long accepted law of a limitation of the wage fund, which led to pessimism and despair because it was the doctrine of perpetual poverty, and has substituted for it the american conception that the only limit to profits and wages is production, which is the doctrine of optimism and hope because it leads to prosperity. here and there the councils of labor are still darkened by the theory that only by limiting individual production can there be any assurance of permanent employment for increasing numbers, but in general, management and wage earner alike have become emancipated from this doom and have entered a new era in industrial thought which has unleashed the productive capacity of the individual worker with an increasing scale of wages and profits, the end of which is not yet. the application of this theory accounts for our widening distribution of wealth. no discovery ever did more to increase the happiness and prosperity of the people.  since 1922 increasing production has increased wages in general 12.9 per cent, while in certain selected trades they have run as high as 34.9 per cent and 38 per cent. even in the boot and shoe shops the increase is over 5 per cent and in woolen mills 8.4 per cent, although these industries have not prospered like others. as the rise in living costs in this period is negligible, these figures represent real wage increases.  the cause of constructive economy requires that the government should cooperate with private interests to eliminate the waste arising from industrial accidents. this item, with all that has been done to reduce it, still reaches enormous proportions with great suffering to the workman and great loss to the country.  women and children  the federal government should continue its solicitous care for the 8,500,000 women wage earners and its efforts in behalf of public health, which is reducing infant mortality and improving the 91odily and mental condition of our citizens.  civil service  the most marked change made in the civil service of the government in the past eight years relates to the increase in salaries. the board of actuaries on the retirement act shows by its report, that july 1, 1921 the average salary of the 330,047 employees subject to the act was j1,307, while on june 30, 1927, the average salary of the corresponding, 405,263 was $1,969. this was an increase in six years of nearly 53 per cent. on top of this was the generous increase made at the last session of the congress generally applicable to federal employees and another bill increasing the pay in certain branches of the postal service beyond the large increase which was made three years ago. this raised the average level from $1,969 to $2,092, making an increase in seven years of over 63 per cent. while it is well known that in the upper brackets the pay in the federal  service is much smaller than in private employment, in the lower brackets, ranging well up over $3,000, it is much higher. it is higher not only in actual money paid, but in privileges granted, a vacation of 30 actual working days, or 5 weeks each year, with additional time running in some departments as high as 30 days for sick leave and the generous provisions of the retirement act. no other body of public servants ever occupied such a fortunate position.  education  through the bureau of education of the department of the interior the federal government, acting in an informative and advisory capacity, has rendered valuable service. while this province be7crigspeculiarly to the states, yet the promotion of education and efficiency in educational methods is a general responsibility of the federal government. a survey of negro colleges and universities in the united states has just been completed l7y the bureau of education through funds provided by the institutions themselves and through private sources. the present status of negro higher education was determined and recommendations were made for its advancement. this was one of the numerous cooperative undertakings of the bureau. following the invitation of the association of land grant colleges and universities, he bureau of education now has under way the survey of agricultural colleges, authorized by congress. the purpose of the survey is to ascertain the accomplishments, the status, and the future objectives of this type of educational training. it is now proposed to undertake a survey of secondary schools, which educators insist is timely and essential.  public buildings  we, have laid out a public building program for the district of columbia and the country at large runni110\\' into hundreds of millions of dollars. three important structures and one annex are already, under way and one addition has been completed in the city of washington. in the country sites have been acquired, many buildings are in course of construction, and some are already completed. plans for all this work are being prepared in order that it may be carried forward as rapidly as possible. this is the greatest building program ever assumed by this nation. it contemplates structures of utility and of beauty. when it reaches completion the people will be well served and the federal city will be supplied with the most beautiful and stately public buildings which adorn any capital in the world.  the american indian  the administration of indian affairs has been receiving intensive study for several years. the department of the interior has been able to provide better supervision of health, education, and industrial advancement of this native race through additional funds provided by the congress. the present cooperative arrangement existing between the bureau of indian affairs and the public health service should be extended. the government\\'s responsibility to the american indian has been acknowledged by annual increases in appropria.l  tions to fulfill its obligations to them and to hasten the time when federal supervision of their affairs may be properly and safely terminated. the movement in congress and in some of the state legislatures for extending responsibility in indian affairs to states should be encouraged. a complete participation by the indian in our economic life is the end to be desired.  the negro  for 65 years now our negro population has been under the peculiar care and solicitude of the national government. the progress which they have made in education and the professions, in wealth and in the arts of civilization, affords one of the most remarkable incidents in this period of world history. they have demonstrated their ability to partake of the advantages of our institutions and to benefit by a free and more and more independent existence. whatever doubt there may have been of their capacity to assume, the status granted to them by the constitution of this union is being rapidly dissipated. their cooperation in the life of the nation is constantly enlarging.  exploiting the negro problem for political ends is being abandoned and their protection is being increased by those states in which their percentage of population is largest. every encouragement should be extended for t le development of the race. the colored people have been the victims of the crime of lynching, which has in late years somewhat decreased. some parts of the south already have wholesome laws for its restraint and punishment. their example might well be followed by other states, and by such immediate remedial legislation as the federal government can extend under the constitution.  philippine islands  under the guidance of governor general stimson the economic and political conditions of the philippine islands have been raised to a standard never before surpassed. the cooperation between his administration and the people of the islands is complete and harmonious. it would be an advantage if relief from double taxation could be granted by the congress to our citizens doing business in the islands.  porto rico  due to the terrific storm that swept porto rico last september, the people of that island suffered large losses. the red cross and the war department went to their rescue. the property loss is being, retrieved. sugar, tobacco, citrus fruit, and coffee, all suffered damage. the first three can largely look after themselves. the coffee growers will need some assistance, which should be *extended strictly on a business basis, and only after most careful investigation. the people of porto rico are not asking for charity.  department of justice  it is desirable that all the legal activities of the government be consolidated under the supervision of the attorney general. in  1870 it was felt necessary to create the department of justice for this purpose. during the intervening period, either through legislation creating law officers or departmental action, additional legal positions not under the supervision of the attorney general have been provided until there are now over 900. such a condition is as harmful to the interest of the government now as it was in 1870, and should be corrected by appropriate legislation.  special government counsel  in order to prosecute the oil cases, i suggested and the congress enacted a law providing for the appointment of two special counsel. they have pursued their work with signal ability, recovering all the leased lands besides nearly $30,000,000 in money, and nearly $17,000,000 in other property. they find themselves hampered by a statute, which the attorney general construes as applying to them, prohibiting their appearing for private clients before any department. for this reason, one has been compelled to resign. no good result is secured by the application of this rule to these counsel, and as mr. roberts has consented to take reappointment if the rule is abrogated i recommend the passage of an amendment to the law creating their office exempting them from the general rule against taking other cases involving the government.  prohibition  the country has duly adopted the eighteenth amendment. those who object to it have the right to advocate its modification or repeal. meantime) it is binding upon the national and state governments and all our inhabitants. the federal enforcement bureau is making every effort to prevent violations, especially through smuggling, manufacture, and transportation, and to prosecute generally all violations for which it can secure evidence. it is bound to continue this policy. under the terms of the constitution, however, the obligation is equally on the states to exercise the power which they have through the executive, legislative. judicial, and police branches of their governments in behalf of enforcement. the federal government is doing and will continue to do all it can in this direction and is entitled to7the active cooperation of the states.  conclusion  the country is in the midst of an era of prosperity more extensive and of peace more permanent than it has ever before experienced. but, having reached this position, we should not fail to comprehend that it can easily be lost. it needs more effort for its support than the less exalted places of the world. we shall not be permitted to take our case, but shall continue to be required to spend our days in unremitting toil. the actions of the government must command the confidence of the country. without this, our prosperity would be lost. we must extend to other countries the largest measure of generosity, moderation, and patience. in addition to dealing justly, we can well afford to walk humbly.  the end of government is to keep open the opportunity for a more  abundant life. peace and prosperity are not finalities; they are only methods. it is too easy under their influence for a nation to become selfish and degenerate. this test has come to the united states. our country has been provided with the resources with which it can enlarge its intellectual, moral, and spiritual life. the issue is in the hands of the people. our faith in man and god is the justification for the belief in our continuing success.'\n",
      " \"to the senate and house of representatives: i have the honor to comply with the requirement of the constitution that i should lay before the congress information as to the state of the union, and recommend consideration of such measures as are necessary and expedient. substantial progress has been made during the year in national peace and security; the fundamental strength of the nation's economic life is unimpaired; education and scientific discovery have made advances; our country is more alive to its problems of moral and spiritual welfare. economic situation during the past 12 months we have suffered with other nations from economic depression. the origins of this depression lie to some extent within our own borders through a speculative period which diverted capital and energy into speculation rather than constructive enterprise. had overspeculation in securities been the only force operating, we should have seen recovery many months ago, as these particular dislocations have generally readjusted themselves. other deep-seated causes have been in action, however, chiefly the world-wide overproduction beyond even the demand of prosperous times for such important basic commodities as wheat, rubber, coffee, sugar, copper, silver, zinc, to some extent cotton, and other raw materials. the cumulative effects of demoralizing price falls of these important commodities in the process of adjustment of production to world consumption have produced financial crises in many countries and have diminished the buying power of these countries for imported goods to a degree which extended the difficulties farther afield by creating unemployment in all the industrial nations. the political agitation in asia; revolutions in south america and political unrest in some european states; the methods of sale by russia of her increasing agricultural exports to european markets; and our own drought—have all contributed to prolong and deepen the depression. in the larger view the major forces of the depression now lie outside of the united states, and our recuperation has been retarded by the unwarranted degree of fear and apprehension created by these outside forces. the extent of the depression is indicated by the following approximate percentages of activity during the past three months as compared with the highly prosperous year of 1928:various other indexes indicate total decrease of activity from 1928 of from 15 to 20 per cent. there are many factors which give encouragement for the future. the fact that we are holding from 80 to 85 per cent of our normal activities and incomes; that our major financial and industrial institutions have come through the storm unimpaired; that price levels of major commodities have remained approximately stable for some time; that a number of industries are showing signs of increasing demand; that the world at large is readjusting itself to the situation; all reflect grounds for confidence. we should remember that these occasions have been met many times before, that they are but temporary, that our country is to-day stronger and richer in resources, in equipment, in skill, than ever in its history. we are in an extraordinary degree self-sustaining, we will overcome world influences and will lead the march of prosperity as we have always done hitherto. economic depression can not be cured by legislative action or executive pronouncement. economic wounds must be healed by the action of the cells of the economic body—the producers and consumers themselves. recovery can be expedited and its effects mitigated by cooperative action. that cooperation requires that every individual should sustain faith and courage; that each should maintain his self-reliance; that each and every one should search for methods of improving his business or service; that the vast majority whose income is unimpaired should not hoard out of fear but should pursue their normal living and recreations; that each should seek to assist his neighbors who may be less fortunate; that each industry should assist its own employees; that each community and each state should assume its full responsibilities for organization of employment and relief of distress with that sturdiness and independence which built a great nation. our people are responding to these impulses in remarkable degree. the best contribution of government lies in encouragement of this voluntary cooperation in the community. the government, national, state, and local, can join with the community in such programs and do its part. a year ago i, together with other officers of the government, initiated extensive cooperative measures throughout the country. the first of these measures was an agreement of leading employers to maintain the standards of wages and of labor leaders to use their influence against strife. in a large sense these undertakings have been adhered to and we have not witnessed the usual reductions of wages which have always heretofore marked depressions. the index of union wage scales shows them to be today fully up to the level of any of the previous three years. in consequence the buying power of the country has been much larger than would otherwise have been the case. of equal importance the nation has had unusual peace in industry and freedom from the public disorder which has characterized previous depressions. the second direction of cooperation has been that our governments, national, state, and local, the industries and business so distribute employment as to give work to the maximum number of employees. the third direction of cooperation has been to maintain and even extend construction work and betterments in anticipation of the future. it has been the universal experience in previous depressions that public works and private construction have fallen off rapidly with the general tide of depression. on this occasion, however, the increased authorization and generous appropriations by the congress and the action of states and municipalities have resulted in the expansion of public construction to an amount even above that in the most prosperous years. in addition the cooperation of public utilities, railways, and other large organizations has been generously given in construction and betterment work in anticipation of future need. the department of commerce advises me that as a result, the volume of this type of construction work, which amounted to roughly $6,300,000,000 in 1929, instead of decreasing will show a total of about $7,000,000,000 for 1930. there has, of course, been a substantial decrease in the types of construction which could not be undertaken in advance of need. the fourth direction of cooperation was the organization in such states and municipalities, as was deemed necessary, of committees to organize local employment, to provide for employment agencies, and to effect relief of distress. the result of magnificent cooperation throughout the country has been that actual suffering has been kept to a minimum during the past 12 months, and our unemployment has been far less in proportion than in other large industrial countries. some time ago it became evident that unemployment would continue over the winter and would necessarily be added to from seasonal causes and that the savings of workpeople would be more largely depleted. we have as a nation a definite duty to see that no deserving person in our country suffers from hunger or cold. i therefore set up a more extensive organization to stimulate more intensive cooperation throughout the country. there has been a most gratifying degree of response, from governors, mayors, and other public officials, from welfare organizations, and from employers in concerns both large and small. the local communities through their voluntary agencies have assumed the duty of relieving individual distress and are being generously supported by the public. the number of those wholly out of employment seeking for work was accurately determined by the census last april as about 2,500,000. the department of labor index of employment in the larger trades shows some decrease in employment since that time. the problem from a relief point of view is somewhat less than the published estimates of the number of unemployed would indicate. the intensive community and individual efforts in providing special employment outside the listed industries are not reflected in the statistical indexes and tend to reduce such published figures. moreover, there is estimated to be a constant figure at all times of nearly 1,000,000 unemployed who are not without annual income but temporarily idle in the shift from one job to another. we have an average of about three breadwinners to each two families, so that every person unemployed does not represent a family without income. the view that the relief problems are less than the gross numbers would indicate is confirmed by the experience of several cities, which shows that the number of families in distress represents from 10 to 20 per cent of the number of the calculated unemployed. this is not said to minimize the very real problem which exists but to weigh its actual proportions. as a contribution to the situation the federal government is engaged upon the greatest program of waterway, harbor, flood control, public building, highway, and airway improvement in all our history. this, together with loans to merchant shipbuilders, improvement of the navy and in military aviation, and other construction work of the government will exceed $520,000,000 for this fiscal year. this compares with $253,000,000 in the fiscal year 1928. the construction works already authorized and the continuation of policies in government aid will require a continual expenditure upwards of half a billion dollars annually.i favor still further temporary expansion of these activities in aid to unemployment during this winter. the congress will, however, have presented to it numbers of projects, some of them under the guise of, rather than the reality of, their usefulness in the increase of employment during the depression. there are certain commonsense limitations upon any expansions of construction work. the government must not undertake works that are not of sound economic purpose and that have not been subject to searching technical investigation, and which have not been given adequate consideration by the congress. the volume of construction work in the government is already at the maximum limit warranted by financial prudence as a continuing policy. to increase taxation for purposes of construction work defeats its own purpose, as such taxes directly diminish employment in private industry. again any kind of construction requires, after its authorization, a considerable time before labor can be employed in which to make engineering, architectural, and legal preparations. our immediate problem is the increase of employment for the next six months, and new plans which do not produce such immediate result or which extend commitments beyond this period are not warranted. the enlarged rivers and harbors, public building, and highway plans authorized by the congress last session, however, offer an opportunity for assistance by the temporary acceleration of construction of these programs even faster than originally planned, especially if the technical requirements of the laws which entail great delays could be amended in such fashion as to speed up acquirements of land and the letting of contracts. with view, however, to the possible need for acceleration, we, immediately upon receiving those authorities from the congress five months ago, began the necessary technical work in preparation for such possible eventuality. i have canvassed the departments of the government as to the maximum amount that can be properly added to our present expenditure to accelerate all construction during the next six months, and i feel warranted in asking the congress for an appropriation of from $100,000,000 to $150,000,000 to provide such further employment in this emergency. in connection therewith we need some authority to make enlarged temporary advances of federal-highway aid to the states. i recommend that this appropriation be made distributable to the different departments upon recommendation of a committee of the cabinet and approval by the president. its application to works already authorized by the congress assures its use in directions of economic importance and to public welfare. such action will imply an expenditure upon construction of all kinds of over $650,000,000 during the next twelve months. agriculture the world-wide depression has affected agriculture in common with all other industries. the average price of farm produce has fallen to about 80 per cent of the levels of 1928. this average is, however, greatly affected by wheat and cotton, which have participated in world-wide overproduction and have fallen to about 60 per cent of the average price of the year 1928. excluding these commodities, the prices of all other agricultural products are about 84 per cent of those of 1928. the average wholesale prices of other primary goods, such as nonferrous metals, have fallen to 76 per cent of 1928. the price levels of our major agricultural commodities are, in fact, higher than those in other principal producing countries, due to the combined result of the tariff and the operations of the farm board. for instance, wheat prices at minneapolis are about 30 per cent higher than at winnipeg, and at chicago they are about 20 per cent higher than at buenos aires. corn prices at chicago are over twice as high as at buenos aires. wool prices average more than 80 per cent higher in this country than abroad, and butter is 30 per cent higher in new york city than in copenhagen. aside from the misfortune to agriculture of the world-wide depression we have had the most severe drought. it has affected particularly the states bordering on the potomac, ohio, and lower mississippi rivers, with some areas in montana, kansas, oklahoma, and texas. it has found its major expression in the shortage of pasturage and a shrinkage in the corn crop from an average of about 2,800,000,000 bushels to about 2,090,000,000 bushels. on august 14 i called a conference of the governors of the most acutely affected states, and as a result of its conclusions i appointed a national committee comprising the heads of the important federal agencies under the chairmanship of the secretary of agriculture. the governors in turn have appointed state committees representative of the farmers, bankers, business men, and the red cross, and subsidiary committees have been established in most of the acutely affected counties. railway rates were reduced on feed and livestock in and out of the drought areas, and over 50,000 cars of such products have been transported under these reduced rates. the red cross established a preliminary fund of $5,000,000 for distress relief purposes and established agencies for its administration in each county. of this fund less than $500,000 has been called for up to this time as the need will appear more largely during the winter. the federal farm loan board has extended its credit facilities, and the federal farm board has given financial assistance to all affected cooperatives. in order that the government may meet its full obligation toward our countrymen in distress through no fault of their own, i recommend that an appropriation should be made to the department of agriculture to be loaned for the purpose of seed and feed for animals. its application should as hitherto in such loans be limited to a gross amount to any one individual, and secured upon the crop. the red cross can relieve the cases of individual distress by the sympathetic assistance of our people. finances of the government i shall submit the detailed financial position of the government with recommendations in the usual budget message. i will at this time, however, mention that the budget estimates of receipts and expenditures for the current year were formulated by the treasury and the budget bureau at a time when it was impossible to forecast the severity of the business depression and have been most seriously affected by it. at that time a surplus of about $123,000,000 was estimated for this fiscal year and tax reduction which affected the fiscal year to the extent of $75,000,000 was authorized by the congress, thus reducing the estimated surplus to about $48,000,000. closely revised estimates now made by the treasury and the bureau of the budget of the tax, postal, and other receipts for the current fiscal year indicate a decrease of about $430,000,000 from the estimate of a year ago, of which about $75,000,000 is due to tax reduction, leaving about $355,000,000 due to the depression. moreover, legislation enacted by congress subsequent to the submission of the budget enlarging federal construction work to expand employment and for increase in veterans' services and other items, have increased expenditures during the current fiscal year by about $225,000,000. thus the decrease of $430,000,000 in revenue and the increase of $225,000,000 in expenditure adversely change the original budget situation by about $655,000,000. this large sum is offset by the original estimated surplus a year ago of about $123,000,000, by the application of $185,000,000 of interest payments upon the foreign debt to current expenditures, by arrangements of the farm board through repayments, etc., in consequence of which they reduced their net cash demands upon the treasury by $100,000,000 in this period, and by about $67,000,000 economies and deferments brought about in the government, thus reducing the practical effect of the change in the situation to an estimated deficit of about $180,000,000 for the present fiscal year. i shall make suggestions for handling the present-year deficit in the budget message, but i do not favor encroachment upon the statutory reduction of the public debt. while it will be necessary in public interest to further increase expenditures during the current fiscal year in aid to unemployment by speeding up construction work and aid to the farmers affected by the drought, i can not emphasize too strongly the absolute necessity to defer any other plans for increase of government expenditures. the budget for 1932 fiscal year indicates estimated expenditure of about $4,054,000,000, including postal deficit. the receipts are estimated at about $4,085,000,000 if the temporary tax reduction of last year be discontinued, leaving a surplus of only about $30,000,000. most rigid economy is therefore necessary to avoid increase in taxes. national defense our army and navy are being maintained at a high state of efficiency, under officers of high training and intelligence, supported by a devoted personnel of the rank and file. the london naval treaty has brought important economies in the conduct of the navy. the navy department will lay before the committees of the congress recommendations for a program of authorization of new construction which should be initiated in the fiscal year of 1932. legislation this is the last session of the seventy-first congress. during its previous sittings it has completed a very large amount of important legislation, notably: the establishment of the federal farm board; fixing congressional reapportionment; revision of the tariff, including the flexible provisions and a reorganization of the tariff commission; reorganization of the radio commission; reorganization of the federal power commission; expansion of federal prisons; reorganization of parole and probation system in federal prisons; expansion of veterans' hospitals; establishment of disability allowances to veterans; consolidation of veteran activities; consolidation and strengthening of prohibition enforcement activities in the department of justice; organization of a narcotics bureau; large expansion of rivers and harbors improvements; substantial increase in federal highways; enlargement of public buildings construction program; and the ratification of the london naval treaty. the congress has before it legislation partially completed in the last sitting in respect to muscle shoals, bus regulation, relief of congestion in the courts, reorganization of border patrol in prevention of smuggling, law enforcement in the district of columbia, and other subjects. it is desirable that these measures should be completed. the short session does not permit of extensive legislative programs, but there are a number of questions which, if time does not permit action, i recommend should be placed in consideration by the congress, perhaps through committees cooperating in some instances with the federal departments, with view to preparation for subsequent action. among them are the following subjects: electrical power i have in a previous message recommended effective regulation of interstate electrical power. such regulation should preserve the independence and responsibility of the states. railways we have determined upon a national policy of consolidation of the railways as a necessity of more stable and more economically operated transportation. further legislation is necessary to facilitate such consolidation. in the public interest we should strengthen the railways that they may meet our future needs. antitrust laws i recommend that the congress institute an inquiry into some aspects of the economic working of these laws. i do not favor repeal of the sherman act. the prevention of monopolies is of most vital public importance. competition is not only the basis of protection to the consumer but is the incentive to progress. however, the interpretation of these laws by the courts, the changes in business, especially in the economic effects upon those enterprises closely related to the use of the natural resources of the country, make such an inquiry advisable. the producers of these materials assert that certain unfortunate results of wasteful and destructive use of these natural resources together with a destructive competition which impoverishes both operator and worker can not be remedied because of the prohibitive interpretation of the antitrust laws. the well-known condition of the bituminous coal industry is an illustration. the people have a vital interest in the conservation of their natural resources; in the prevention of wasteful practices; in conditions of destructive competition which may impoverish the producer and the wage earner; and they have an equal interest in maintaining adequate competition. i therefore suggest that an inquiry be directed especially to the effect of the workings of the antitrust laws in these particular fields to determine if these evils can be remedied without sacrifice of the fundamental purpose of these laws. capital-gains tax it is urged by many thoughtful citizens that the peculiar economic effect of the income tax on so-called capital gains at the present rate is to enhance speculative inflation and likewise impede business recovery. i believe this to be the case and i recommend that a study be made of the economic effects of this tax and of its relation to the general structure of our income tax law. immigration there is need for revision of our immigration laws upon a more limited and more selective basis, flexible to the needs of the country. under conditions of current unemployment it is obvious that persons coming to the united states seeking work would likely become either a direct or indirect public charge. as a temporary measure the officers issuing visas to immigrants have been, in pursuance of the law, instructed to refuse visas to applicants likely to fall into this class. as a result the visas issued have decreased from an average of about 24,000 per month prior to restrictions to a rate of about 7,000 during the last month. these are largely preferred persons under the law. visas from mexico are about 250 per month compared to about 4,000 previous to restrictions. the whole subject requires exhaustive reconsideration. deportation of alien criminals i urge the strengthening of our deportation laws so as to more fully rid ourselves of criminal aliens. furthermore, thousands of persons have entered the country in violation of the immigration laws. the very method of their entry indicates their objectionable character, and our law-abiding foreign-born residents suffer in consequence. i recommend that the congress provide methods of strengthening the government to correct this abuse. post office due to deferment of government building over many years, previous administrations had been compelled to enter upon types of leases for secondary facilities in large cities, some of which were objectionable as representing too high a return upon the value of the property. to prevent the occasion for further uneconomic leasing i recommend that the congress authorize the building by the government of its own facilities. veterans the nation has generously expanded its care for veterans. the consolidation of all veterans' activities into the veterans' administration has produced substantial administrative economies. the consolidation also brings emphasis to the inequalities in service and allowances. the whole subject is under study by the administrator, and i recommend it should also be examined by the committees of the congress. social service i urge further consideration by the congress of the recommendations i made a year ago looking to the development through temporary federal aid of adequate state and local services for the health of children and the further stamping out of communicable disease, particularly in the rural sections. the advance of scientific discovery, methods, and social thought imposes a new vision in these matters. the drain upon the federal treasury is comparatively small. the results both economic and moral are of the utmost importance. general it is my belief that after the passing of this depression, when we can examine it in retrospect, we shall need to consider a number of other questions as to what action may be taken by the government to remove possible governmental influences which make for instability and to better organize mitigation of the effect of depression. it is as yet too soon to constructively formulate such measures. there are many administrative subjects, such as departmental reorganization, extension of the civil service, readjustment of the postal rates, etc., which at some appropriate time require the attention of the congress. foreign relations our relations with foreign countries have been maintained upon a high basis of cordiality and good will. during the past year the london naval pact was completed, approved by the senate, and ratified by the governments concerned. by this treaty we have abolished competition in the building of warships, have established the basis of parity of the united states with the strongest of foreign powers, and have accomplished a substantial reduction in war vessels. during the year there has been an extended political unrest in the world. asia continues in disturbed condition, and revolutions have taken place in brazil, argentina, peru, and bolivia. despite the jeopardy to our citizens and their property which naturally arises in such circumstances, we have, with the cooperation of the governments concerned, been able to meet all such instances without friction. we have resumed normal relations with the new governments of brazil, argentina, peru, and bolivia immediately upon evidence that they were able to give protection to our citizens and their property, and that they recognized their international obligations. a commission which was supported by the congress has completed its investigation and reported upon our future policies in respect to haiti and proved of high value in securing the acceptance of these policies. an election has been held and a new government established. we have replaced our high commissioner by a minister and have begun the gradual withdrawal of our activities with view to complete retirement at the expiration of the present treaty in 1935. a number of arbitration and conciliation treaties have been completed or negotiated during the year, and will be presented for approval by the senate. i shall, in a special message, lay before the senate the protocols covering the statutes of the world court which have been revised to accord with the sense of previous senate reservations.\"\n",
      " 'to the senate and house of representatives: it is my duty under the constitution to transmit to the congress information on the state of the union and to recommend for its consideration necessary and expedient measures. the chief influence affecting the state of the union during the past year has been the continued world-wide economic disturbance. our national concern has been to meet the emergencies it has created for us and to lay the foundations for recovery. if we lift our vision beyond these immediate emergencies we find fundamental national gains even amid depression. in meeting the problems of this difficult period, we have witnessed a remarkable development of the sense of cooperation in the community. for the first time in the history of our major economic depressions there has been a notable absence of public disorders and industrial conflict. above all there is an enlargement of social and spiritual responsibility among the people. the strains and stresses upon business have resulted in closer application, in saner policies, and in better methods. public improvements have been carried out on a larger scale than even in normal times. the country is richer in physical property, in newly discovered resources, and in productive capacity than ever before. there has been constant gain in knowledge and education; there has been continuous advance in science and invention; there has been distinct gain in public health. business depressions have been recurrent in the life of our country and are but transitory. the nation has emerged from each of them with increased strength and virility because of the enlightenment they have brought, the readjustments and the larger understanding of the realities and obligations of life and work which come from them. national defense both our army and navy have been maintained in a high state of efficiency. the ability and devotion of both officers and men sustain the highest traditions of the service. reductions and postponements in expenditure of these departments to meet the present emergency are being made without reducing existing personnel or impairing the morale of either establishment. the agreement between the leading naval powers for limitation of naval armaments and establishment of their relative strength and thus elimination of competitive building also implies for ourselves the gradual expansion of the deficient categories in our navy to the parities provided in those treaties. however, none of the other nations, parties to these agreements, is to-day maintaining the full rate of construction which the treaty size of fleets would imply. although these agreements secured the maximum reduction of fleets which it was at that time possible to attain, i am hopeful that the naval powers, party to these agreements, will realize that establishment of relative strength in itself offers opportunity for further reduction without injury to any of them. this would be the more possible if pending negotiations are successful between france and italy. if the world is to regain its standards of life, it must further decrease both naval and other arms. the subject will come before the general disarmament conference which meets in geneva on february 2 foreign affairs we are at peace with the world. we have cooperated with other nations to preserve peace. the rights of our citizens abroad have been protected. the economic depression has continued and deepened in every part of the world during the past year. in many countries political instability, excessive armaments, debts, governmental expenditures, and taxes have resulted in revolutions, in unbalanced budgets and monetary collapse and financial panics, in dumping of goods upon world markets, and in diminished consumption of commodities. within two years there have been revolutions or acute social disorders in 19 countries, embracing more than half the population of the world. ten countries have been unable to meet their external obligations. in 14 countries, embracing a quarter of the world\\'s population, former monetary standards have been temporarily abandoned. in a number of countries there have been acute financial panics or compulsory restraints upon banking. these disturbances have many roots in the dislocations from the world war. every one of them has reacted upon us. they have sharply affected the markets and prices of our agricultural and industrial products. they have increased unemployment and greatly embarrassed our financial and credit system. as our difficulties during the past year have plainly originated in large degree from these sources, any effort to bring about our own recuperation has dictated the necessity of cooperation by us with other nations in reasonable effort to restore world confidence and economic stability. cooperation of our federal reserve system and our banks with the central banks in foreign countries has contributed to localize and ameliorate a number of serious financial crises or moderate the pressures upon us and thus avert disasters which would have affected us. the economic crisis in germany and central europe last june rose to the dimensions of a general panic from which it was apparent that without assistance these nations must collapse. apprehensions of such collapse had demoralized our agricultural and security markets and so threatened other nations as to impose further dangers upon us. but of highest importance was the necessity of cooperation on our part to relieve the people of germany from imminent disasters and to maintain their important relations to progress and stability in the world. upon the initiative of this government a year\\'s postponement of reparations and other intergovernmental debts was brought about. upon our further initiative an agreement was made by germany\\'s private creditors providing for an extension of such credits until the german people can develop more permanent and definite forms of relief. we have continued our policy of withdrawing our marines from haiti and nicaragua. the difficulties between china and japan have given us great concern, not alone for the maintenance of the spirit of the kellogg-briand pact, but for the maintenance of the treaties to which we are a party assuring the territorial integrity of china. it is our purpose to assist in finding solutions sustaining the full spirit of those treaties.i shall deal at greater length with our foreign relations in a later message. the domestic situation many undertakings have been organized and forwarded during the past year to meet the new and changing emergencies which have constantly confronted us. broadly the community has cooperated to meet the needs of honest distress, and to take such emergency measures as would sustain confidence in our financial system and would cushion the violence of liquidation in industry and commerce, thus giving time for orderly readjustment of costs, inventories, and credits without panic and widespread bankruptcy. these measures have served those purposes and will promote recovery. in these measures we have striven to mobilize and stimulate private initiative and local and community responsibility. there has been the least possible government entry into the economic field, and that only in temporary and emergency form. our citizens and our local governments have given a magnificent display of unity and action, initiative and patriotism in solving a multitude of difficulties and in cooperating with the federal government. for a proper understanding of my recommendations to the congress it is desirable very briefly to review such activities during the past year. the emergencies of unemployment have been met by action in many directions. the appropriations for the continued speeding up of the great federal construction program have provided direct and indirect aid to employment upon a large scale. by organized unity of action, the states and municipalities have also maintained large programs of public improvement. many industries have been prevailed upon to anticipate and intensify construction. industrial concerns and other employers have been organized to spread available work amongst all their employees, instead of discharging a portion of them. a large majority have maintained wages at as high levels as the safe conduct of their business would permit. this course has saved us from industrial conflict and disorder which have characterized all previous depressions. immigration has been curtailed by administrative action. upon the basis of normal immigration the decrease amounts to about 300,000 individuals who otherwise would have been added to our unemployment. the expansion of federal employment agencies under appropriations by the congress has proved most effective. through the president\\'s organization for unemployment relief, public and private agencies were successfully mobilized last winter to provide employment and other measures against distress. similar organization gives assurance against suffering during the coming winter. committees of leading citizens are now active at practically every point of unemployment. in the large majority they have been assured the funds necessary which, together with local government aids, will meet the situation. a few exceptional localities will be further organized. the evidence of the public health service shows an actual decrease of sickness and infant and general mortality below normal years. no greater proof could be adduced that our people have been protected from hunger and cold and that the sense of social responsibility in the nation has responded to the need of the unfortunate.to meet the emergencies in agriculture the loans authorized by congress for rehabilitation in the drought areas have enabled farmers to produce abundant crops in those districts. the red cross undertook and magnificently administered relief for over 2,500,000 drought sufferers last winter. it has undertaken this year to administer relief to 100,000 sufferers in the new drought area of certain northwest states. the action of the federal farm board in granting credits to farm cooperatives saved many of them from bankruptcy and increased their purpose and strength. by enabling farm cooperatives to cushion the fall in prices of farm products in 1930 and 1931 the board secured higher prices to the farmer than would have been obtained otherwise, although the benefits of this action were partially defeated by continued world overproduction. incident to this action the failure of a large number of farmers and of country banks was averted which could quite possibly have spread into a major disaster. the banks in the south have cooperated with the farm board in creation of a pool for the better marketing of accumulated cotton. growers have been materially assisted by this action. constant effort has been made to reduce overproduction in relief of agriculture and to promote the foreign buying of agricultural products by sustaining economic stability abroad. to meet our domestic emergencies in credit and banking arising from the reaction to acute crisis abroad the national credit association was set up by the banks with resources of $500,000,000 to support sound banks against the frightened withdrawals and hoarding. it is giving aid to reopen solvent banks which have been closed. federal officials have brought about many beneficial unions of banks and have employed other means which have prevented many bank closings. as a result of these measures the hoarding withdrawals which had risen to over $250,000,000 per week after the british crisis have substantially ceased. further measures the major economic forces and weaknesses at home and abroad have now been exposed and can be appraised, and the time is ripe for forward action to expedite our recovery. although some of the causes of our depression are due to speculation, inflation of securities and real estate, unsound foreign investments, and mismanagement of financial institutions, yet our self-contained national economy, with its matchless strength and resources, would have enabled us to recover long since but for the continued dislocations, shocks, and setbacks from abroad. whatever the causes may be, the vast liquidation and readjustments which have taken place have left us with a large degree of credit paralysis, which together with the situation in our railways and the conditions abroad, are now the outstanding obstacles to recuperation. if we can put our financial resources to work and can ameliorate the financial situation in the railways, i am confident we can make a large measure of recovery independent of the rest of the world. a strong america is the highest contribution to world stability. one phase of the credit situation is indicated in the banks. during the past year banks, representing 3 per cent of our total deposits have been closed. a large part of these failures have been caused by withdrawals for hoarding, as distinguished from the failures early in the depression where weakness due to mismanagement was the larger cause of failure. despite their closing, many of them will pay in full. although such withdrawals have practically ceased, yet $1,100,000,000 of currency was previously withdrawn which has still to return to circulation. this represents a large reduction of the ability of our banks to extend credit which would otherwise fertilize industry and agriculture. furthermore, many of our bankers, in order to prepare themselves to meet possible withdrawals, have felt compelled to call in loans, to refuse new credits, and to realize upon securities, which in turn has demoralized the markets. the paralysis has been further augmented by the steady increase in recent years of the proportion of bank assets invested in long-term securities, such as mortgages and bonds. these securities tend to lose their liquidity in depression or temporarily to fall in value so that the ability of the banks to meet the shock of sudden withdrawal is greatly lessened and the restriction of all kinds of credit is thereby increased. the continuing credit paralysis has operated to accentuate the deflation and liquidation of commodities, real estate, and securities below any reasonable basis of values. all of this tends to stifle business, especially the smaller units, and finally expresses itself in further depression of prices and values, in restriction on new enterprise, and in increased unemployment. the situation largely arises from an unjustified lack of confidence. we have enormous volumes of idle money in the banks and in hoarding. we do not require more money or working capital—we need to put what we have to work. the fundamental difficulties which have brought about financial strains in foreign countries do not exist in the united states. no external drain on our resources can threaten our position, because the balance of international payments is in our favor; we owe less to foreign countries than they owe to us; our industries are efficiently organized; our currency and bank deposits are protected by the greatest gold reserve in history. our first step toward recovery is to reestablish confidence and thus restore the flow of credit which is the very basis of our economic life. we must put some steel beams in the foundations of our credit structure. it is our duty to apply the full strength of our government not only to the immediate phases, but to provide security against shocks and the repetition of the weaknesses which have been proven. the recommendations which i here lay before the congress are designed to meet these needs by strengthening financial, industrial, and agricultural life through the medium of our existing institutions, and thus to avoid the entry of the government into competition with private business. federal government finance the first requirement of confidence and of economic recovery is financial stability of the united states government. i shall deal with fiscal questions at greater length in the budget message. but i must at this time call attention to the magnitude of the deficits which have developed and the resulting necessity for determined and courageous policies. these deficits arise in the main from the heavy decrease in tax receipts due to the depression and to the increase in expenditure on construction in aid to unemployment, aids to agriculture, and upon services to veterans. during the fiscal year ending june 30 last we incurred a deficit of about $903,000,000, which included the statutory reduction of the debt and represented an increase of the national debt by $616,000,000. of this, however, $153,000,000 is offset by increased cash balances. in comparison with the fiscal year 1928 there is indicated a fall in federal receipts for the present fiscal year amounting to $1,683,000,000, of which $1,034,000,000 is in individual and corporate income taxes alone. during this fiscal year there will be an increased expenditure, as compared to 1928, on veterans of $255,000,000, and an increased expenditure on construction work which may reach $520,000,000. despite large economies in other directions, we have an indicated deficit, including the statutory retirement of the debt, of $2,123,000,000, and an indicated net debt increase of about $1,711,000,000. the budget for the fiscal year beginning july 1 next, after allowing for some increase of taxes under the present laws and after allowing for drastic reduction in expenditures, still indicates a deficit of $1,417,000,000. after offsetting the statutory debt retirements this would indicate an increase in the national debt for the fiscal year 1933 of about $921,000,000. several conclusions are inevitable. we must have insistent and determined reduction in government expenses. we must face a temporary increase in taxes. such increase should not cover the whole of these deficits or it will retard recovery. we must partially finance the deficit by borrowing. it is my view that the amount of taxation should be fixed so as to balance the budget for 1933 except for the statutory debt retirement. such government receipts would assure the balance of the following year\\'s budget including debt retirement. it is my further view that the additional taxation should be imposed solely as an emergency measure terminating definitely two years from july 1 next. such a basis will give confidence in the determination of the government to stabilize its finance and will assure taxpayers of its temporary character. even with increased taxation, the government will reach the utmost safe limit of its borrowing capacity by the expenditures for which we are already obligated and the recommendations here proposed. to go further than these limits in either expenditures, taxes, or borrowing will destroy confidence, denude commerce and industry of its resources, jeopardize the financial system, and actually extend unemployment and demoralize agriculture rather than relieve it. federal land banks i recommend that the congress authorize the subscription by the treasury of further capital to the federal land banks to be retired as provided in the original act, or when funds are available, and that repayments of such capital be treated as a fund available for further subscriptions in the same manner. it is urgent that the banks be supported so as to stabilize the market values of their bonds and thus secure capital for the farmers at low rates, that they may continue their services to agriculture and that they may meet the present situation with consideration to the farmers. deposits in closed banks a method should be devised to make available quickly to depositors some portion of their deposits in closed banks as the assets of such banks may warrant. such provision would go far to relieve distress in a multitude of families, would stabilize values in many communities, and would liberate working capital to thousands of concerns. i recommend that measures be enacted promptly to accomplish these results and i suggest that the congress should consider the development of such a plan through the federal reserve banks. home-loan discount banks i recommend the establishment of a system of home-loan discount banks as the necessary companion in our financial structure of the federal reserve banks and our federal land banks. such action will relieve present distressing pressures against home and farm property owners. it will relieve pressures upon and give added strength to building and loan associations, savings banks, and deposit banks, engaged in extending such credits. such action would further decentralize our credit structure. it would revive residential construction and employment. it would enable such loaning institutions more effectually to promote home ownership. i discussed this plan at some length in a statement made public november 14, last. this plan has been warmly indorsed by the recent national conference upon home ownership and housing, whose members were designated by the governors of the states and the groups interested. reconstruction finance corporation in order that the public may be absolutely assured and that the government may be in position to meet any public necessity, i recommend that an emergency reconstruction corporation of the nature of the former war finance corporation should be established. it may not be necessary to use such an instrumentality very extensively. the very existence of such a bulwark will strengthen confidence. the treasury should be authorized to subscribe a reasonable capital to it, and it should be given authority to issue its own debentures. it should be placed in liquidation at the end of two years. its purpose is that by strengthening the weak spots to thus liberate the full strength of the nation\\'s resources. it should be in position to facilitate exports by american agencies; make advances to agricultural credit agencies where necessary to protect and aid the agricultural industry; to make temporary advances upon proper securities to established industries, railways, and financial institutions which can not otherwise secure credit, and where such advances will protect the credit structure and stimulate employment. its functions would not overlap those of the national credit corporation. federal reserve eligibility on october 6th i issued a statement that i should recommend to the congress an extension during emergencies of the eligibility provisions in the federal reserve act. this statement was approved by a representative gathering of the members of both houses of the congress, including members of the appropriate committees. it was approved by the officials of the treasury department, and i understand such an extension has been approved by a majority of the governors of the federal reserve banks. nothing should be done which would lower the safeguards of the system. the establishment of the mortgage-discount banks herein referred to will also contribute to further reserve strength in the banks without inflation. banking laws our people have a right to a banking system in which their deposits shall be safeguarded and the flow of credit less subject to storms. the need of a sounder system is plainly shown by the extent of bank failures. i recommend the prompt improvement of the banking laws. changed financial conditions and commercial practices must be met. the congress should investigate the need for separation between different kinds of banking; an enlargement of branch banking under proper restrictions; and the methods by which enlarged membership in the federal reserve system may be brought about. postal savings banks the postal savings deposits have increased from about $200,000,000 to about $550,000,000 during the past year. this experience has raised important practical questions in relation to deposits and investments which should receive the attention of the congress. railways the railways present one of our immediate and pressing problems. they are and must remain the backbone of our transportation system. their prosperity is interrelated with the prosperity of all industries. their fundamental service in transportation, the volume of their employment, their buying power for supplies from other industries, the enormous investment in their securities, particularly their bonds, by insurance companies, savings banks, benevolent and other trusts, all reflect their partnership in the whole economic fabric. through these institutions the railway bonds are in a large sense the investment of every family. the well-maintained and successful operation and the stability of railway finances are of primary importance to economic recovery. they should have more effective opportunity to reduce operating costs by proper consolidation. as their rates must be regulated in public interest, so also approximate regulation should be applied to competing services by some authority. the methods of their regulation should be revised. the interstate commerce commission has made important and far-reaching recommendations upon the whole subject, which i commend to the early consideration of the congress. antitrust laws in my message of a year ago i commented on the necessity of congressional inquiry into the economic action of the antitrust laws. there is wide conviction that some change should be made especially in the procedure under these laws. i do not favor their repeal. such action would open wide the door to price fixing, monopoly, and destruction of healthy competition. particular attention should be given to the industries rounded upon natural resources, especially where destructive competition produces great wastes of these resources and brings great hardships upon operators, employees, and the public. in recent years there has been continued demoralization in the bituminous coal, oil, and lumber industries. i again commend the matter to the consideration of the congress. unemployment as an aid to unemployment the federal government is engaged in the greatest program of public-building, harbor, flood-control, highway, waterway, aviation, merchant and naval ship construction in all history. our expenditures on these works during this calendar year will reach about $780,000,000 compared with $260,000,000 in 1928. through this increased construction, through the maintenance of a full complement of federal employees, and through services to veterans it is estimated that the federal taxpayer is now directly contributing to the livelihood of 10,000,000 of our citizens. we must avoid burdens upon the government which will create more unemployment in private industry than can be gained by further expansion of employment by the federal government. we can now stimulate employment and agriculture more effectually and speedily through the voluntary measures in progress, through the thawing out of credit, through the building up of stability abroad, through the home loan discount banks, through an emergency finance corporation and the rehabilitation of the railways and other such directions. i am opposed to any direct or indirect government dole. the breakdown and increased unemployment in europe is due in part to such practices. our people are providing against distress from unemployment in true american fashion by a magnificent response to public appeal and by action of the local governments. general legislation there are many other subjects requiring legislative action at this session of the congress. i may list the following among them: veterans\\' services the law enacted last march authorizing loans of 50 per cent upon adjusted-service certificates has, together with the loans made under previous laws, resulted in payments of about $1,260,000,000. appropriations have been exhausted. the administrator of veterans\\' affairs advises that a further appropriation of $200,000,000 is required at once to meet the obligations made necessary by existing legislation. there will be demands for further veterans\\' legislation; there are inequalities in our system of veterans\\' relief; it is our national duty to meet our obligations to those who have served the nation. but our present expenditure upon these services now exceeds $1,000,000,000 per annum. i am opposed to any extension of these expenditures until the country has recovered from the present situation. electrical-power regulationi have recommended in previous messages the effective regulation of interstate electrical power as the essential function of the reorganized federal power commission. i renew the recommendation. it is urgently needed in public protection. muscle shoals at my suggestion, the governors and legislatures of alabama and tennessee selected three members each for service on a committee to which i appointed a representative of the farm organizations and two representatives of the war department for the purpose of recommending a plan for the disposal of these properties which would be in the interest of the people of those states and the agricultural industry throughout the country. i shall transmit the recommendations to the congress. reorganization of federal departments i have referred in previous messages to the profound need of further reorganization and consolidation of federal administrative functions to eliminate overlap and waste, and to enable coordination and definition of government policies now wholly impossible in scattered and conflicting agencies which deal with parts of the same major function. i shall lay before the congress further recommendations upon this subject, particularly in relation to the department of the interior. there are two directions of such reorganization, however, which have an important bearing upon the emergency problems with which we are confronted. shipping board at present the shipping board exercises large administrative functions independent of the executive. these administrative functions should be transferred to the department of commerce, in keeping with that single responsibility which has been the basis of our governmental structure since its foundation. there should be created in that department a position of assistant secretary for merchant marine, under whom this work and the several bureaus having to do with merchant marine may be grouped. the shipping board should be made a regulatory body acting also in advisory capacity on loans and policies, in keeping with its original conception. its regulatory powers should be amended to include regulation of coastwise shipping so as to assure stability and better service. it is also worthy of consideration that the regulation of rates and services upon the inland waterways should be assigned to such a reorganized board. reorganization of public works administration i recommend that all building and construction activities of the government now carried on by many departments be consolidated into an independent establishment under the president to be known as the \"public works administration\" directed by a public works administrator. this agency should undertake all construction work in service to the different departments of the government (except naval and military work). the services of the corps of army engineers should be delegated in rotation for military duty to this administration in continuation of their supervision of river and harbor work. great economies, sounder policies, more effective coordination to employment, and expedition in all construction work would result from this consolidation. law enforcement i shall present some recommendations in a special message looking to the strengthening of criminal-law enforcement and improvement in judicial procedure connected therewith. inland waterway and harbor improvement these improvements are now proceeding upon an unprecedented scale. some indication of the volume of work in progress is conveyed by the fact that during the current year over 380,000,000 cubic yards of material have been moved—an amount equal to the entire removal in the construction of the panama canal. the mississippi waterway system, connecting chicago, kansas city, pittsburgh, and new orleans, will be in full operation during 1933. substantial progress is being made upon the projects of the upper missouri, upper mississippi, etc. negotiations are now in progress with canada for the construction of the st. lawrence waterway. the tariff wages and standards of living abroad have been materially lowered during the past year. the temporary abandonment of the gold standard by certain countries has also reduced their production costs compared to ours. fortunately any increases in the tariff which may be necessary to protect agriculture and industry from these lowered foreign costs, or decreases in items which may prove to be excessive, may be undertaken at any time by the tariff commission under authority which it possesses by virtue of the tariff act of 1930. the commission during the past year has reviewed the rates upon over 254 items subject to tariff. as a result of vigorous and industrious action, it is up to date in the consideration of pending references and is prepared to give prompt attention to any further applications. this procedure presents an orderly method for correcting inequalities. i am opposed to any general congressional revision of the tariff. such action would disturb industry, business, and agriculture. it would prolong the depression. immigration and deportation i recommend that immigration restriction now in force under administrative action be placed upon a more definite basis by law. the deportation laws should be strengthened. aliens lawfully in the country should be protected by the issuance of a certificate of residence. public health i again call attention to my previous recommendations upon this subject, particularly in its relation to children. the moral results are of the utmost importance. conclusion it is inevitable that in these times much of the legislation proposed to the congress and many of the recommendations of the executive must be designed to meet emergencies. in reaching solutions we must not jeopardize those principles which we have found to be the basis of the growth of the nation. the federal government must not encroach upon nor permit local communities to abandon that precious possession of local initiative and responsibility. again, just as the largest measure of responsibility in the government of the nation rests upon local self-government, so does the largest measure of social responsibility in our country rest upon the individual. if the individual surrenders his own initiative and responsibilities, he is surrendering his own freedom and his own liberty. it is the duty of the national government to insist that both the local governments and the individual shall assume and bear these responsibilities as a fundamental of preserving the very basis of our freedom. many vital changes and movements of vast proportions are taking place in the economic world. the effect of these changes upon the future can not be seen clearly as yet. of this, however, we are sure: our system, based upon the ideals of individual initiative and of equality of opportunity, is not an artificial thing. rather it is the outgrowth of the experience of america, and expresses the faith and spirit of our people. it has carried us in a century and a half to leadership of the economic world. if our economic system does not match our highest expectations at all times, it does not require revolutionary action to bring it into accord with any necessity that experience may prove. it has successfully adjusted itself to changing conditions in the past. it will do so again. the mobility of our institutions, the richness of our resources, and the abilities of our people enable us to meet them unafraid. it is a distressful time for many of our people, but they have shown qualities as high in fortitude, courage, and resourcefulness as ever in our history. with that spirit, i have faith that out of it will come a sounder life, a truer standard of values, a greater recognition of the results of honest effort, and a healthier atmosphere in which to rear our children. ours must be a country of such stability and security as can not fail to carry forward and enlarge among all the people that abundant life of material and spiritual opportunity which it has represented among all nations since its beginning.'\n",
      " 'to the senate and house of representatives: in accord with my constitutional duty, i transmit herewith to the congress information upon the state of the union together with recommendation of measures for its consideration. our country is at peace. our national defense has been maintained at a high state of effectiveness. all of the executive departments of the government have been conducted during the year with a high devotion to public interest. there has been a far larger degree of freedom from industrial conflict than hitherto known. education and science have made further advances. the public health is to-day at its highest known level. while we have recently engaged in the aggressive contest of a national election, its very tranquillity and the acceptance of its results furnish abundant proof of the strength of our institutions. in the face of widespread hardship our people have demonstrated daily a magnificent sense of humanity, of individual and community responsibility for the welfare of the less fortunate. they have grown in their conceptions and organization for cooperative action for the common welfare. in the provision against distress during this winter, the great private agencies of the country have been mobilized again; the generosity of our people has again come into evidence to a degree in which all america may take great pride. likewise the local authorities and the states are engaged everywhere in supplemental measures of relief. the provisions made for loans from the reconstruction finance corporation, to states that have exhausted their own resources, guarantee that there should be no hunger or suffering from cold in the country. the large majority of states are showing a sturdy cooperation in the spirit of the federal aid. the surgeon general, in charge of the public health service, furnishes me with the following information upon the state of public health: mortality rate per 1,000 of population on an annual basis from representative statesthe sickness rates from data available show the same trends. these facts indicate the fine endeavor of the agencies which have been mobilized for care of those in distress. economic situation the unparalleled world-wide economic depression has continued through the year. due to the european collapse, the situation developed during last fall and winter into a series of most acute crises. the unprecedented emergency measures enacted and policies adopted undoubtedly saved the country from economic disaster. after serving to defend the national security, these measures began in july to show their weight and influence toward improvement of conditions in many parts of the country. the following tables of current business indicators show the general economic movement during the past eleven months. monthly business indices with seasonal variations eliminated[monthly average 1923-1925=100] the measures and policies which have procured this turn toward recovery should be continued until the depression is passed, and then the emergency agencies should be promptly liquidated. the expansion of credit facilities by the federal reserve system and the reconstruction finance corporation has been of incalculable value. the loans of the latter for reproductive works, and to railways for the creation of employment; its support of the credit structure through loans to banks, insurance companies, railways, building and loan associations, and to agriculture has protected the savings and insurance policies of millions of our citizens and has relieved millions of borrowers from duress; they have enabled industry and business to function and expand. the assistance given to farm loan banks, the establishment of the home loan banks and agricultural credit associations—all in their various ramifications have placed large sums of money at the disposal of the people in protection and aid. beyond this, the extensive organization of the country in voluntary action has produced profound results. the following table indicates direct expenditures of the federal government in aid to unemployment, agriculture, and financial relief over the past four years. the sums applied to financial relief multiply themselves many fold, being in considerable measure the initial capital supplied to the reconstruction finance corporation, farm loan banks, etc., which will be recovered to the treasury.(1) public building, highways, rivers and harbors and their maintenance, naval and other vessels construction, hospitals, etc. continued constructive policies promoting the economic recovery of the country must be the paramount duty of the government. the result of the agencies we have created and the policies we have pursued has been to buttress our whole domestic financial structure and greatly to restore credit facilities. but progress in recovery requires another element as well—that is fully restored confidence in the future. institutions and men may have resources and credit but unless they have confidence progress is halting and insecure. there are three definite directions in which action by the government at once can contribute to strengthen further the forces of recovery by strengthening of confidence. they are the necessary foundations to any other action, and their accomplishment would at once promote employment and increase prices. the first of these directions of action is the continuing reduction of all government expenditures, whether national, state, or local. the difficulties of the country demand undiminished efforts toward economy in government in every direction. embraced in this problem is the unquestioned balancing of the federal budget. that is the first necessity of national stability and is the foundation of further recovery. it must be balanced in an absolutely safe and sure manner if full confidence is to be inspired. the second direction for action is the complete reorganization at once of our banking system. the shocks to our economic life have undoubtedly been multiplied by the weakness of this system, and until they are remedied recovery will be greatly hampered. the third direction for immediate action is vigorous and whole souled cooperation with other governments in the economic field. that our major difficulties find their origins in the economic weakness of foreign nations requires no demonstration. the first need to-day is strengthening of commodity prices. that can not be permanently accomplished by artificialities. it must be accomplished by expansion in consumption of goods through the return of stability and confidence in the world at large and that in turn can not be fully accomplished without cooperation with other nations. balancing the budget i shall in due course present the executive budget to the congress. it will show proposed reductions in appropriations below those enacted by the last session of the congress by over $830,000,000. in addition i shall present the necessary executive orders under the recent act authorizing the reorganization of the federal government which, if permitted to go into force, will produce still further substantial economies. these sums in reduction of appropriations will, however, be partially offset by an increase of about $250,000,000 in uncontrollable items such as increased debt services, etc. in the budget there is included only the completion of the federal public works projects already undertaken or under contract. speeding up of federal public works during the past four years as an aid to employment has advanced many types of such improvements to the point where further expansion can not be justified in their usefulness to the government or the people. as an aid to unemployment we should beyond the normal constructive programs substitute reproductive or so-called self-liquidating works. loans for such purposes have been provided for through the reconstruction finance corporation. this change in character of projects directly relieves the taxpayer and is capable of expansion into a larger field than the direct federal works. the reproductive works constitute an addition to national wealth and to future employment, whereas further undue expansion of federal public works is but a burden upon the future. the federal construction program thus limited to commitments and work in progress under the proposed appropriations contemplates expenditures for the next fiscal year, including naval and other vessel construction, as well as other forms of public works and maintenance, of a total of $442,769,000, as compared with $717,262,000 for the present year. the expenditure on such items over the four years ending june 30 next will amount to $2,350,000,000, or an amount of construction work eight times as great as the cost of the panama canal and, except for completion of certain long-view projects, places the nation in many directions well ahead of its requirements for some years to come. a normal program of about $200,000,000 per annum should hereafter provide for the country\\'s necessities and will permit substantial future reduction in federal expenditures. i recommend that the furlough system installed last year be continued not only because of the economy produced but because, being tantamount to the \"5-day week,\" it sets an example which should be followed by the country and because it embraces within its workings the \"spread work\" principle and thus serves to maintain a number of public servants who would otherwise be deprived of all income. i feel, however, in view of the present economic situation and the decrease in the cost of living by over 20 per cent, that some further sacrifice should be made by salaried officials of the government over and above the 8 1/3 per cent reduction under the furlough system. i will recommend that after exempting the first $1,000 of salary there should be a temporary reduction for one year of 11 per cent of that part of all government salaries in excess of the $1,000 exemption, the result of which, combined with the furlough system, will average about 14.8 per cent reduction in pay to those earning more than $1,000. i will recommend measures to eliminate certain payments in the veterans\\' services. i conceive these outlays were entirely beyond the original intentions of congress in building up veterans\\' allowances. many abuses have grown up from ill-considered legislation. they should be eliminated. the nation should not ask for a reduction in allowances to men and dependents whose disabilities rise out of war service nor to those veterans with substantial service who have become totally disabled from non-war-connected causes and who are at the same time without other support. these latter veterans are a charge on the community at some point, and i feel that in view of their service to the nation as a whole the responsibility should fall upon the federal government. many of the economies recommended in the budget were presented at the last session of the congress but failed of adoption. if the economy and appropriations committees of the congress in canvassing these proposed expenditures shall find further reductions which can be made without impairing essential government services, it will be welcomed both by the country and by myself. but under no circumstances do i feel that the congress should fail to uphold the total of reductions recommended. some of the older revenues and some of the revenues provided under the act passed during the last session of the congress, particularly those generally referred to as the nuisance taxes, have not been as prolific of income as had been hoped. further revenue is necessary in addition to the amount of reductions in expenditures recommended. many of the manufacturers\\' excise taxes upon selected industries not only failed to produce satisfactory revenue, but they are in many ways unjust and discriminatory. the time has come when, if the government is to have an adequate basis of revenue to assure a balanced budget, this system of special manufacturers\\' excise taxes should be extended to cover practically all manufactures at a uniform rate, except necessary food and possibly some grades of clothing. at the last session the congress responded to my request for authority to reorganize the government departments. the act provides for the grouping and consolidation of executive and administrative agencies according to major purpose, and thereby reducing the number and overlap and duplication of effort. executive orders issued for these purposes are required to be transmitted to the congress while in session and do not become effective until after the expiration of 60 calendar days after such transmission, unless the congress shall sooner approve. i shall issue such executive orders within a few days grouping or consolidating over fifty executive and administrative agencies including a large number of commissions and \"independent\" agencies. the second step, of course, remains that after these various bureaus and agencies are placed cheek by jowl into such groups, the administrative officers in charge of the groups shall eliminate their overlap and still further consolidate these activities. therein lie large economies. the congress must be warned that a host of interested persons inside and outside the government whose vision is concentrated on some particular function will at once protest against these proposals. these same sorts of activities have prevented reorganization of the government for over a quarter of a century. they must be disregarded if the task is to be accomplished. banking the basis of every other and every further effort toward recovery is to reorganize at once our banking system. the shocks to our economic system have undoubtedly multiplied by the weakness of our financial system. i first called attention of the congress in 1929 to this condition, and i have unceasingly recommended remedy since that time. the subject has been exhaustively investigated both by the committees of the congress and the officers of the federal reserve system. the banking and financial system is presumed to serve in furnishing the essential lubricant to the wheels of industry, agriculture, and commerce, that is, credit. its diversion from proper use, its improper use, or its insufficiency instantly brings hardship and dislocation in economic life. as a system our banking has failed to meet this great emergency. it can be said without question of doubt that our losses and distress have been greatly augmented by its wholly inadequate organization. its inability as a system to respond to our needs is to-day a constant drain upon progress toward recovery. in this statement i am not referring to individual banks or bankers. thousands of them have shown distinguished courage and ability. on the contrary, i am referring to the system itself, which is so organized, or so lacking in organization, that in an emergency its very mechanism jeopardizes or paralyzes the action of sound banks and its instability is responsible for periodic dangers to our whole economic system. bank failures rose in 1931 to 10 1/2 per cent of all the banks as compared to 1 1/2 per cent of the failures of all other types of enterprise. since january 1, 1930, we have had 4,665 banks suspend, with $3,300,000,000 in deposits. partly from fears and drains from abroad, partly from these failures themselves (which indeed often caused closing of sound banks), we have witnessed hoarding of currency to an enormous sum, rising during the height of the crisis to over $1,600,000,000. the results from interreaction of cause and effect have expressed themselves in strangulation of credit which at times has almost stifled the nation\\'s business and agriculture. the losses, suffering, and tragedies of our people are incalculable. not alone do they lie in the losses of savings to millions of homes, injury by deprival of working capital to thousands of small businesses, but also, in the frantic pressure to recall loans to meet pressures of hoarding and in liquidation of failed banks, millions of other people have suffered in the loss of their homes and farms, businesses have been ruined, unemployment increased, and farmers\\' prices diminished. that this failure to function is unnecessary and is the fault of our particular system is plainly indicated by the fact that in great britain, where the economic mechanism has suffered far greater shocks than our own, there has not been a single bank failure during the depression. again in canada, where the situation has been in large degree identical with our own, there have not been substantial bank failures. the creation of the reconstruction finance corporation and the amendments to the federal reserve act served to defend the nation in a great crisis. they are not remedies; they are relief. it is inconceivable that the reconstruction corporation, which has extended aid to nearly 6,000 institutions and is manifestly but a temporary device, can go on indefinitely. it is to-day a matter of satisfaction that the rate of bank failures, of hoarding, and the demands upon the reconstruction corporation have greatly lessened. the acute phases of the crisis have obviously passed and the time has now come when this national danger and this failure to respond to national necessities must be ended and the measures to end them can be safely undertaken. methods of reform have been exhaustively examined. there is no reason now why solution should not be found at the present session of the congress. inflation of currency or governmental conduct of banking can have no part in these reforms. the government must abide within the field of constructive organization, regulation, and the enforcement of safe practices only. parallel with reform in the banking laws must be changes in the federal farm loan banking system and in the joint stock land banks. some of these changes should be directed to permanent improvement and some to emergency aid to our people where they wish to fight to save their farms and homes. i wish again to emphasize this view—that these widespread banking reforms are a national necessity and are the first requisites for further recovery in agriculture and business. they should have immediate consideration as steps greatly needed to further recovery. economic cooperation with other nations our major difficulties during the past two years find their origins in the shocks from economic collapse abroad which in turn are the aftermath of the great war. if we are to secure rapid and assured recovery and protection for the future we must cooperate with foreign nations in many measures. we have actively engaged in a world disarmament conference where, with success, we should reduce our own tax burdens and the tax burdens of other major nations. we should increase political stability of the world. we should lessen the danger of war by increasing defensive powers and decreasing offensive powers of nations. we would thus open new vistas of economic expansion for the world. we are participating in the formulation of a world economic conference, successful results from which would contribute much to advance in agricultural prices, employment, and business. currency depreciation and correlated forces have contributed greatly to decrease in price levels. moreover, from these origins rise most of the destructive trade barriers now stifling the commerce of the world. we could by successful action increase security and expand trade through stability in international exchange and monetary values. by such action world confidence could be restored. it would bring courage and stability, which will reflect into every home in our land. the european governments, obligated to us in war debts, have requested that there should be suspension of payments due the united states on december 15 next, to be accompanied by exchange of views upon this debt question. our government has informed them that we do not approve of suspension of the december 15 payments. i have stated that i would recommend to the congress methods to overcome temporary exchange difficulties in connection with this payment from nations where it may be necessary. in the meantime i wish to reiterate that here are three great fields of international action which must be considered not in part but as a whole. they are of most vital interest to our people. within them there are not only grave dangers if we fail in right action but there also tie immense opportunities for good if we shall succeed. within success there lie major remedies for our economic distress and major progress in stability and security to every fireside in our country. the welfare of our people is dependent upon successful issue of the great causes of world peace, world disarmament, and organized world recovery. nor is it too much to say that to-day as never before the welfare of mankind and the preservation of civilization depend upon our solution of these questions. such solutions can not be attained except by honest friendship, by adherence to agreements entered upon until mutually revised and by cooperation amongst nations in a determination to find solutions which will be mutually beneficial. other legislation i have placed various legislative needs before the congress in previous messages, and these views require no amplification on this occasion. i have urged the need for reform in our transportation and power regulation, in the antitrust laws as applied to our national resource industries, western range conservation, extension of federal aid to child health services, membership in the world court, the ratification of the great lakes-st. lawrence seaway treaty, revision of the bankruptcy acts, revision of federal court procedure, and many other pressing problems. these and other special subjects i shall where necessary deal with by special communications to the congress. the activities of our government are so great, when combined with the emergency activities which have arisen out of the world crisis, that even the briefest review of them would render the annual message unduly long. i shall therefore avail myself of the fact that every detail of the government is covered in the reports to the congress by each of the departments and agencies of the government. conclusion it seems to me appropriate upon this occasion to make certain general observations upon the principles which must dominate the solution of problems now pressing upon the nation. legislation in response to national needs will be effective only if every such act conforms to a complete philosophy of the people\\'s purposes and destiny. ours is a distinctive government with a unique history and background, consciously dedicated to specific ideals of liberty and to a faith in the inviolable sanctity of the individual human spirit. furthermore, the continued existence and adequate functioning of our government in preservation of ordered liberty and stimulation of progress depends upon the maintenance of state, local, institutional, and individual sense of responsibility. we have builded a system of individualism peculiarly our own which must not be forgotten in any governmental acts, for from it have grown greater accomplishments than those of any other nation. on the social and economic sides, the background of our american system and the motivation of progress is essentially that we should allow free play of social and economic forces as far as will not limit equality of opportunity and as will at the same time stimulate the initiative and enterprise of our people. in the maintenance of this balance the federal government can permit of no privilege to any person or group. it should act as a regulatory agent and not as a participant in economic and social life. the moment the government participates, it becomes a competitor with the people. as a competitor it becomes at once a tyranny in whatever direction it may touch. we have around us numerous such experiences, no one of which can be found to have justified itself except in cases where the people as a whole have met forces beyond their control, such as those of the great war and this great depression, where the full powers of the federal government must be exerted to protect the people. but even these must be limited to an emergency sense and must be promptly ended when these dangers are overcome. with the free development of science and the consequent multitude of inventions, some of which are absolutely revolutionary in our national life, the government must not only stimulate the social and economic responsibility of individuals and private institutions but it must also give leadership to cooperative action amongst the people which will soften the effect of these revolutions and thus secure social transformations in an orderly manner. the highest form of self-government is the voluntary cooperation within our people for such purposes. but i would emphasize again that social and economic solutions, as such, will not avail to satisfy the aspirations of the people unless they conform with the traditions of our race deeply grooved in their sentiments through a century and a half of struggle for ideals of life that are rooted in religion and fed from purely spiritual springs.'\n",
      " 'mr. speaker, mr. president, distinguished members of the congress,  honored guests and fellow citizens, thank you for allowing me to delay my  address until this evening. we paused together to mourn and honor the valor of  our seven challenger heroes . and i hope that we are now ready to do what they  would want us to do — go forward america and reach for the stars. (applause.)  we will never forget those brave seven, but we shall go forward.mr. speaker, before i begin my prepared remarks, may i point out that  tonight marks the 10th and last state of the union message that you\\'ve  presided over. and on behalf of the american people, i want to salute you  for your service to congress and country. (applause)i have come to review with you the progress of our nation, to speak of  unfinished work, and to set our sights on the future. i am pleased to  report the state of our union is stronger than a year ago, and growing  stronger each day. (applause.) tonight, we look out on a rising america —  firm of heart, united in spirit, powerful in pride and patriotism —  america is on the move!but, it wasn\\'t long ago that we looked out on a different land — locked  factory gates, long gasoline lines, intolerable prices and interest rates  turning the greatest country on earth into a land of broken dreams.  government growing beyond our consent had become a lumbering giant,  slamming shut the gates of opportunity, threatening to crush the very roots of  our freedom.what brought america back? the american people brought us back — with  quiet courage and common sense; (applause) with undying faith that in this  nation under god the future will be ours, for the future belongs to the  free.tonight the american people deserve our thanks — for 37 straight months  of economic growth; for sunrise firms and modernized industries creating 9  million new jobs in 3 years; interest rates cut in half, inflation falling  over from 12 percent in 1980 to under 4 today; and a mighty river of good  works, a record $74 billion in voluntary giving just last year alone.and despite the pressures of our modern world, family and community  remain the moral core of our society, guardians of our values and hopes for  the future. family and community are the co-stars of this great american  comeback. they are why we say tonight: private values must be at the heart of  public policies.what is true for families in america is true for america in the family  of free nations. history is no captive of some inevitable force. history is  made by men and women of vision and courage. tonight, freedom is on the  march. the united states is the economic miracle, the model to which the  world once again turns. we stand for an idea whose time is now: only by  lifting the weights from the shoulders of all can people truly prosper and can  peace among all nations be secure.teddy roosevelt said that a nation that does great work lives forever.  we have done well, but we cannot stop at the foothills when everest  beckons. it\\'s time for america to be all that we can be.we speak tonight of an \"agenda for the future,\"  an agenda for a safer, more secure world. and we speak about the  necessities for actions to steel us for the challenges of growth, trade and  security in the next decade and the year 2000. and we will do it — not by  breaking faith with bedrock principles, but by breaking free from failed policies. (applause.)let us begin where storm clouds loom darkest — right here in  washington, d.c. this week i will send you our detailed proposals; tonight,  let us speak of our responsibility to redefine government\\'s role: not to  control, not to demand or command, not to contain us; but to help in times of  need, and above all, to create a ladder of opportunity to full  employment so that all americans can climb toward economic power and  justice on their own.but we cannot win the race to the future shackled to a system that can\\'t  even pass a federal budget. we cannot win that race held back by  horse-and-buggy programs that waste tax dollars and squander human  potential. we cannot win that race if we\\'re swamped in a sea of red ink.now, mr. speaker, you know, i know, and the american people know the  federal budget system is broken. it doesn\\'t work. before we leave this  city, let\\'s you and i work together to fix it. (applause.) and then we can  finally given the american people a balanced budget. (applause.)members of congress, passage of  gramm-rudman-hollings gives us an  historic opportunity to achieve what has eluded our national leadership for  decades, forcing federal government to live within its means.your schedule now requires that the budget resolution be passed by april  15th, the very day america\\'s families have to foot the bill for the budgets  that you produce.how often we read of a husband and wife both working, struggling from  paycheck to paycheck to raise a family, meet a mortgage, pay their taxes  and bills. and yet, some in congress say taxes must be raised. well, i\\'m  sorry — they\\'re asking the wrong people to tighten their belts.  (applause.) it\\'s time we reduce the federal budget and left the family  budget alone. (applause.) we do not face large deficits because american  families are undertaxed; we face those deficits because the federal  government overspends.the detailed budget that we will submit will meet the  gramm-rudman-hollings target for deficit reductions, meet our commitment to  ensure a strong national defense, meet our commitment to protect social  security and the truly less fortunate, and, yes, meet our commitment to not  raise taxes. (applause.)how should we accomplish this? well, not by taking from those in need.  as families take care of their own, government must provide shelter and  nourishment for those who cannot provide for themselves. but we must revise or  replace programs enacted in the name of compassion that degrade the moral  worth of work, encourage family breakups, and drive entire communities  into a bleak and heartless dependency.gramm-rudman-hollings can mark a dramatic improvement. but experience  shows that simply setting deficit targets does not assure they\\'ll be met. we  must proceed with grace commission reforms against waste. and tonight, i ask  you to give me what 43 governors have — give me a line-item veto this year.  (applause.) give me the authority to veto waste, and i\\'ll take the  responsibility, i\\'ll make the cuts, i\\'ll take the heat.this authority would not give me any monopoly power, but simply prevent  spending measures from sneaking through that could not pass on their own  merit. and you can sustain or override my veto — that\\'s, that\\'s the way the  system should work. once we\\'ve made the hard choices, we should lock in our  gains with a balanced budget amendment to the constitution. (applause.) i  mentioned that we will meet our commitment to national defense. we must  meet it. defense is not just another budget expense. keeping america strong,  free, and at peace is solely the responsibility of the federal government;  it is government\\'s prime responsibility. we have devoted five years trying  to narrow a dangerous gap born of illusion and neglect. and we\\'ve made  important gains. yet the threat from soviet forces, conventional and  strategic, from the soviet drive for domination, from the increase in  espionage and state terror remains great. this is reality. closing our eyes  will not make reality disappear.we pledge together to hold real growth in defense spending to the bare  minimum. my budget honors that pledge. and i\\'m now asking you, the  congress, to keep its end of the bargain. the soviets must know that if  america reduces her defenses, it will be because of a reduced threat, not a  reduced resolve. (applause.)keeping america strong is as vital to the national security as  controlling federal spending is to our economic security. but, as i have  said before, the most powerful force we can enlist against the federal  deficit is an ever-expanding american economy, unfettered and free.the magic of opportunity — unreserved, unfailing, unrestrained — isn\\'t  this the calling that unites us? i believe our tax rate cuts for the people  have done more to spur a spirit of risk-taking and help america\\'s economy  break free than any program since john kennedy\\'s tax cut almost a quarter  century ago.now history calls us to press on, to complete efforts for an historic  tax reform providing new opportunity for all and ensuring that all pay  their fair share — but no more. we\\'ve come this far. will you join me now and  we\\'ll walk this last mile together? (applause.)you know my views on this. we cannot and we will not accept tax reform  that is a tax increase in disguise. true reform must be an engine of  productivity and growth, and that means a top personal rate no higher than 35  percent. true reform must be truly fair and that means raising personal  exemptions to $2,000. true reform means a tax system that at long last is  pro-family, pro-jobs, pro-future, and pro-america. (applause.)as we knock down the barriers to growth, we must redouble our efforts  for freer and fairer trade. we have already taken actions to counter unfair  trading practices to pry open closed foreign markets. we will continue to do  so. we will also oppose legislation touted as providing protection that in  reality pits one american worker against another, one industry against  another, one community against another, and that raises prices for us all. if  the united states can trade with other nations on a level playing field, we  can out-produce, out-compete, and out-sell anybody, anywhere in the world.  (applause.)the constant expansion of our economy and exports requires a sound and  stable dollar at home and reliable exchange rates around the world. we must  never gain permit wild currency swings to cripple our farmers and other  exporters. farmers, in particular, have suffered from past unwise  government policies. they must not be abandoned with problems they did not  create and cannot control. we\\'ve begun coordinating economic and monetary  policy among our major trading partners. but therehs more to do, and  tonight i am directing treasury secretary jim baker to determine if the  nations of the world should convene to discuss the role and relationship of our  currencies. (applause.)confident in our future, and secure in our values, americans are  striving forward to embrace the future. we see it not only in our recovery,  but in three straight years of falling crime rates, as families and  communities band together to fight pornography, drugs, and lawlessness, and to  give back to their children the safe and, yes, innocent childhood they  deserve. we see it in the renaissance in education, the rising sat  scores for three years — last year\\'s increase the greatest since 1963. it  wasn\\'t government and washington lobbies that turned education around, it was  the american people who, in reaching for excellence, knew to reach back to  basics. we must continue the advance by supporting discipline in our schools; vouchers that give parents freedom of choice; and we must give  back to our children their lost right to acknowledge god in their  classrooms. (applause.)we are a nation of idealists, yet today there is a wound in our national  conscience; america will never be whole as long as the right to life  granted by our creator is denied to the unborn. for the rest of my time, i  shall do what i can to see that this wound is one day healed. (applause.)as we work to make the american dream real for all, we must also look to  the condition of america\\'s families. struggling parents today worry how  they will provide their children the advantages that their parents gave  them. in the welfare culture, the breakdown of the family, the most basic  support system, has reached crisis proportions — in female and child  poverty, child abandonment, horrible crimes and deteriorating schools.  after hundreds of billions of dollars in poverty programs, the plight of the  poor grows more painful. but the waste in dollars and cents pales  before the most tragic loss — the sinful waste of human spirit and potential.we can ignore this terrible truth no longer. as  franklin roosevelt  warned 51 years ago, standing before this chamber, he said, \"welfare  is a narcotic, a subtle destroyer of the human spirit.\" and we must  now escape the spider\\'s web of dependency. tonight i am charging the  white house domestic council to present me by december 1, 1986, an  evaluation of programs and a strategy for immediate action to meet the  financial, educational, social, and safety concerns of poor families. i am talking about real and lasting emancipation, because the success of welfare  should be judged by how many of its recipients become independent of  welfare. (applause.)further, after seeing how devastating illness can destroy the financial  security of the family, i am directing the secretary of health and human  services, dr. otis bowen, to report to me by year end with recommendations on  how the private sector and government can work together to address the  problems of affordable insurance for those whose life savings would  otherwise be threatened when catastrophic illness strikes.and tongight i want to speak directly to america\\'s younger generation,  because you hold the destiny of our nation in your hands. with all the  temptations young people face it sometimes seems the allure of the  permissive society requires superhuman feats of self-control. but the call of  the future is too strong, the challenge too great to get lost in the blind  alleyways of dissolution, drugs, and despair.never has there been a more exciting time to be alive — a time of  rousing wonder and heroic achievement. as they said in the film, back to  the future, \"where we are going, we don\\'t need roads.\"  well, today physicists peering into the infinitely small realms of  subatomic particles find reaffirmations of religious faith. astronomers build a  space telescope that can see to the edge of the universe and possibly back to  the moment of creation.so, yes, this nation remains fully committed to  america\\'s space program .  we\\'re going forward with our shuttle flights, we\\'re going forward to build  our space station, and we are going forward with research on a new orient  express that could, by the end of the next decade, take off from dulles  airport, accelerate up to 25 times the speed of sound, attaining low earth  orbit or flying to tokyo within two hours. (applause.)and the same technology transforming our lives can solve the greatest  problem of the 20th century. a security shield can one day render nuclear  weapons obsolete and free mankind from the prison of nuclear terror.  (applause.) america met one historic challenge and went to the moon. now  america must meet another — to make our strategic defense real for all the  citizens of planet earth.let us speak of our deepest longing for the future — to leave our  children a land that is free and just and a world at peace. it is my hope  that our fireside summit in geneva and mr. gorbachev\\'s upcoming visit to  america can lead to a more stable relationship. surely no people no earth  hate war more or love peace more than we americans. (applause.)but we cannot stroll into the future with child-like faith. our  differences with a system that openly proclaims and practices an alleged  right to command people\\'s lives and to export its ideology by force are  deep and abiding.logic and history compel us to accept that our relationship be guided by  realism — rockhard, clear-eyed, steady, and sure. our negotiators in  geneva have proposed a radical cut in offensive forces by each side, with no  cheating. they have made clear that soviet compliance with the letter and  spirit of agreements is essential. if the soviet government wants an  agreement that truly reduces nuclear arms, there will be an agreement.  (applause.)but arms control is no substitute for peace. we know that peace follows  in freedom\\'s path and conflicts erupt when the will of the people is  denied. so we must prepare for peace not only by reducing weapons but by  bolstering prosperity, liberty, and democracy however and wherever we can.  (applause.)we advance the promise of opportunity every time we speak out on behalf  of lower tax rates, freer markets, sound currencies around the world. we  strengthen the family of freedom evey time we work with allies and come to the  aid of friends under seige. and we can enlarge the family of free nations  if we will defend the unalienable rights of all god\\'s children to follow  their dreams.to those imprisoned in regimed held captive, to those beaten for daring  to fight for freedom and democracy — for their right to worship, to speak, to  live and to prosper in the family of free nations — we say to you  tonight: you are not alone freedom fighters. america will support you with  moral and material assistance your right not just to fight and die for  freedom, but to fight and with freedom — (applause) — to win freedom in  afghanistan; in angola; in cambodia; and in nicaragua . (applause.)this is a great moral challenge for the entire world. surely, no issue  is more important for peace in our own hemisphere, for the security of our  frontiers, for the protection of our vital interests — than to achieve  democracy in nicaragua and to protect nicaragua\\'s democratic neighbors.this year i will be asking congress for the means to do what must be  done for the great and good cause. as scoop jackson, the inspiration for  our bipartisan commission on central america, once said, \"in  matters of national security, the best politics is no politics.\"  (applause.)what we accomplish the year, in each challenge we face, will set our  course for the balance of the decade, indeed for the remainder of the  century. after all we\\'ve done so far, let no one say that this nation  cannot reach the destiny of our dreams. america believes, america is ready,  america can win the race to the future — and we shall.the american dream is a song of hope that rings through night winter  air. vivid, tender music that warms our hearts when the least among us  aspire to the greatest things — to venture a daring enterprises; to  unearth new beauty in music, literature, and art; to discover a new  universe inside a tiny silicon chip or a single human cell.we see the dream coming true in the spirit of discovery of richard  cavoli — all his life he\\'s been enthralled by the mysteries of medicine.  and richard, we know that the experiment that you began in high school was  launched and lost last week, yet your dream lives. and as long as it\\'s  real, work of noble note will yet be done — work that could reduce the  harmful effects of x rays on patients and enable astronomers to view the  golden gateways of the farthest stars.we see the dream glow in the towering talent of a twelve year-old,  tyrone ford — a child prodigy of gospel music, he has surmounted personal  adversity to become an accomplished pianist and singer. he also directs the  choirs of three churches and has performed at the kennedy center.with god as your composer, tyrone, your music will be the music of  angels.we see the dream being saved by the courage of the thirteen year-old,  shelby butler — honor student and member of her school\\'s safety patrol.  seeing another girl freeze in terror before an out-of-control school bus, she  riksed her life and pulled her to safety. with bravery like yours, shelby,  america need never fear for our future.and we see the dream born again in the joyful compassion of a thirteen  year-old, trevor ferrell. two years ago, age eleven, watching men and women  bedding down in abandoned doorways — on television he was watching —  trevor left his suburban philadelphia home to bring blankets and food to the  helpless and homeless. and now, 250 people help him fulfill his nightly vigil.trevor, yours is the living spirit of brotherly love. would you four  stand up for a moment? (applause.)thank you, thank you. you are heroes of our hearts. we look at you and  know it\\'s true — in this land of dreams fulfilled, where greater dreams  may be imagined, nothing is impossible, no victory is beyond our reach, no  glory will every be too great.so now, it\\'s up to us, all of us, to prepare america for that day when  our work will pale before the greatness of america\\'s champions in the 21st  century. the world\\'s hopes rest with america\\'s future; america\\'s hopes rest  with us. so let us go forward to create our world of tomorrow in faith, in  unity, and in love.god bless you and god bless america. (applause.)'\n",
      " 'thank you very much. mr. speaker, mr. president, distinguished members of congress, honored guests and fellow citizens. may i congratulate all of you who are members of this historic 100th congress of the united states of america. in this 200th anniversary year of our constitution, you and i stand on the shoulders of giants — men whose words and deeds put wind in the sails of freedom.however, we must always remember that our constitution is to be celebrated not for being old, but for being young — young with the same energy, spirit, and promise that filled each eventful day in philadelphia\\'s state house. we will be guided tonight by their acts; and we will be guided forever by their words.now, forgive me, but i can\\'t resist sharing a story from those historic days. philadelphia was bursting with civic pride in the spring of 1787, and its newspapers began embellishing the arrival of the convention delegates with elaborate social classifications.governors of states were called \"excellency.\" justices and chancellors had reserved for them \"honorable\" with a capital \"h.\" for congressmen, it was \"honorable\" with a small \"h.\" and all others were referred to as \"the following respectable characters.\" (laughter.)well, for this 100th congress, i invoke special executive powers to declare that each of you must never be titled less than honorable with a capital \"h.\" (applause.) incidentally, i\\'m delighted you\\'re celebrating the 100th birthday of the congress. it\\'s always a pleasure to congratulate someone with more birthdays than i\\'ve had. (laughter.)now, there\\'s a new face at this place of honor tonight. and please join me in warm congratulations to the speaker of the house, jim wright. (applause.) mr. speaker, you might recall a similar situation in your very first session of congress, 32 years ago. then, as now, the speakership had changed hands and another great son of texas, sam rayburn — \"mr. sam\" — sat in your chair. i cannot find better words than those used by president eisenhower that evening. he said, \"we shall have much to do together; i am sure that we will get it done and that we shall do it in harmony and goodwill.\" (applause.)tonight, i renew that pledge. to you, mr. speaker, and to senate majority leader robert byrd, who brings 34 years of distinguished service to the congress, may i say: though there are changes in the congress, america\\'s interests remain the same. and i am confident that, along with republican leaders bob michel and bob dole, this congress can make history. (applause.)six years ago, i was here to ask the congress to join me in america\\'s new beginning. well, the results are something of which we can all be proud. our inflation rate is now the lowest in a in a quarter of a century.the prime interest rate has fallen from the 21 and a half percent the month before we took office to seven and a half percent today, and those rates have triggered the most housing starts in eight years.the unemployment rate — still too high — is the lowest in nearly seven years, and our people have created nearly 13 million new jobs. over 61 percent of everyone over the age of 16, male and female, is employed the highest percentagc on record.let\\'s roll up our sleeves and go to work, and put america\\'s economic engine at full throttle. (applause.)we can also be heartened by our progress across the world. most important, america is at peace tonight, and freedom is on the march. and we\\'ve done much these past years to restore our defenses, our alliances, and our leadership in the world. (applause.) our sons and daughters in the services once again wear their uniforms with pride.but though we\\'ve made much progress, i have one major regret. i took a risk with regard to our action in iran. it did not work, and for that i assume full responsibility.the goals were worthy. i do not believe it was wrong to try to establish contacts with a country of strategic importance or to try to save lives. and certainly it was not wrong to try to secure freedom for our citizens held in barbaric captivity. (applause.) but we did not achieve what we wished, and serious mistakes were made in trying to do so. we will get to the bottom of this, and i will take whatever action is called for.but in debating the past (applause) — in debating the past, we must not deny ourselves the successes of the future. let it never be said of this generation of americans that we became so obsessed with failure that we refused to take risks that could further the cause of peace and freedom in the world. (applause.)much is at stake here, and the nation and the world are watching — to see if we go forward together in the national interest, or if we let partisanship weaken us.and let there be no mistake about american policy: we will not sit idly by if our interests or our friends in the middle east are threatened, nor will we yield to terrorist blackmail.and now, ladies and gentlemen of the congress, why don\\'t we get to work? (applause.)i am pleased to report that, because of our efforts to rebuild the strength of america, the world is a safer place. earlier this month, i submitted a budget to defend america and maintain our momentum to make up for neglect in the last decade. well, i ask you to vote out a defense and foreign affairs budget that says \"yes\" to protecting our country. while the world is safer, it is not safe.since 1970, the soviets have invested $500 billion more on their military forces than we have. even today, though nearly one in three soviet families is without running hot water, and the average family spends two hours a day shopping for the basic necessities of life, their government still found the resources to transfer $75 billion in weapons to client states in the past five years — clients like syria, vietnam, cuba, libya, angola, ethiopia, afghanistan, and nicaragua.with 120,000 soviet combat and military personnel and 15,000 military advisers in asia, africa, and latin america, can anyone still doubt their single-minded determination to expand their power? despite this, the congress cut my request for critical u.s. security assistance to free nations by 21 percent this year, and cut defense requests by $85 billion in the last three years. (applause.)these assistance programs serve our national interests as well as mutual interests, and when the programs are devastated, american interests are harmed. my friends, it\\'s my duty as president to say to you again tonight that there is no surer way to lose freedom than to lose our resolve. (applause.)today, the brave people of afghanistan are showing that resolve. the soviet union says it wants a peaceful settlement in afghanistan, yet it continues a brutal war and props up a regime whose days are clearly numbered. we are ready to support a political solution that guarantees the rapid withdrawal of all soviet troops and genuine self-determination for the afghan people.in central america, too, the cause of freedom is being tested. and our resolve is being tested there as well. here, especially, the world is watching to see how this nation responds.today, over 90 percent of the people of latin america live in democracy. democracy is on the march in central and south america. communist nicaragua is the odd man out — suppressing the church, the press, and democratic dissent and promoting subversion in the region. we support diplomatic efforts, but these efforts can never succeed if the  sandinistas win their war against the nicaraguan people.our commitment to a western hemisphere safe from aggression did not occur by spontaneous generation on the day that we took office. it began with the monroe doctrine in 1823 and continues our historic bipartisan american policy. franklin roosevelt said we \"are determined to do everything possible to maintain peace on this hemisphere.\" president truman was very blunt: \"international communism seeks to crush and undermine and destroy the independence of the americans. we cannot let that happen here.\" and john f. kennedy made clear that \"communist domination in this hemisphere can never be neqotiated.\" (applause.)some in this congress may choose to depart from this historic commitment, but i will not. (applause.)this year we celebrate the second century of our constitution. the sandinistas just signed theirs two weeks ago -and then suspended it. we won\\'t know how my words tonight will be reported there, for one simple reason: there is no free press in nicaragua.nicaraguan freedom fighters have never asked us to wage their battle, but i will fight and effort to shut off their lifeblood and consign them to death, defeat, or a life without freedom. there must be no soviet beachhead in central america. (applause.)you know, we americans have always preferred dialogue to conflict, and so we always remain open to more constructive relations with the soviet union. but more responsible soviet conduct around the world is a key element of the u.s.-soviet agenda. progress is also required on the other items of our agenda as well real respect for human rights, and more open contacts between our societies, and, of course, arms reduction.in iceland last october, we had one moment of opportunity that the soviets dashed because they sought to cripple our strategic defense initiative — sdi. i wouldn\\'t let them do it then. i won\\'t let them do it now or in the future. (applause.) this is the most positive and promising defense program we have undertaken. it\\'s the path for both sides — to a safer future; a system that defends human life instead of threatening it. sdi will go forward.the united states has made serious, fair, and far-reaching proposals to the soviet union, and this is a moment of rare opportunity for arms reduction. but i will need, and american negotiators in geneva will need congress\\' support. enacting the soviet negotiating position into american law would not be the way to win a good agreement. (applause.) so i must tell you in this congress i will veto any effort that undercuts our national security and our negotiating leverage. (applause.)now, today, we also find ourselves engaged in expanding peaceful commerce across the world. we will work to expand our opportunities in international markets through the uruquay round of trade negotiations and to complete an historic free trade arrangement between the world\\'s two largest trading partners — canada and the united states.our basic trade policy remains the same: we remain opposed as ever to protectionism because america\\'s growth and future depend on trade. but we would insist on trade that is fair and free. we are always willing to be trade partners but never trade patsies. (applause.)now from foreign borders, let us return to our own because america in the world is only as strong as america at home.this looth congress has high responsibilities. i begin with a gentle reminder that many of these are simply the incomplete obligations of the past. the american people deserve to be impatient because we do not yet have the public house in order.we\\'ve had great success in restoring our economic integrity, and we\\'ve rescued our nation from the worst economic mess since the depression.but there\\'s more to do. for starters, the federal deficit is outrageous. (applause.)for years i\\'ve asked that we stop pushing onto our children the excesses of our government. (applause.) and what the congress finally needs to do is pass a constitutional amendment that mandates a balanced budget — (applause) and forces government to live within its means. states, cities, and the families of america balance their budgets. why can\\'t we? (applause.)next — the budget process is a sorry spectacle. (applause.) the missing of deadlines and the nightmare of monstrous continuing resolutions packing hundreds of billions of dollars of spending into one bill must be stopped. (applause.)we ask the congress, once again: give us the same tool that 43 governors have — a line-item veto so we can carve out the boondoggles and pork — (applause) — those items that would never survive on their own. i will send the congress broad recommendations on the budget, but first i\\'d like to see yours. let\\'s go to work and get this done together. (applause.)but now, let\\'s talk about this year\\'s budget. even though i have submitted it within the gramm-rudman-hollings deficit reduction target, i have seen suggestions that we might postpone that timetable. well, i think the american people are tired of hearing the same old excuses. (applause.) together, we made a commitment to balance the budget: now, let\\'s keep it. (applause.)as for those suggestions that the answer is higher taxes, the american people have repeatedly rejected that shopworn advice. they know that we don\\'t have deficits because people are are taxed too little; we have deficits because big government spends too much. (applause.)now, next month, next month, i\\'ll place two additional reforms before the congress.we\\'ve created a welfare monster that is a shocking indictment of our sense of priorities. our national welfare system consists of some 59 major programs and over 6,000 pages of federal laws and regulations on which more than $132 billion was spent in 1985.i will propose a new national welfare strategy — a program of welfare reform through state-sponsored, community-based demonstration projects. this is the time to reform this outmoded social dinosaur and finally break the poverty trap. now, we will never abandon those who, through no fault of their own, must have our help. but let us work to see how many can be freed from the dependency of welfare and made self-supporting, which the great majority of welfare recipients want more than anything else. (applause.)next, let us remove a financial specter facing our older americans — the fear of an illness so expensive that it can result in having to make an intolerable choice between bankruptcy and death. i will submit legislation shortly to help free the elderly from the fear of catastrophic illness. (applause.)now, let\\'s turn to the future.it\\'s widely said that america is losing her competitive edge. well, that won\\'t happen if we act now. how well prepared are we to enter the 21st century? in my lifetime, america set the standard for the world. it is now time to determine that we should enter the next century having chieved a level of excellence unsurpassed in history.we will achieve this first, by guaranteeing that government does everything possible to promote america\\'s ability to compete. second, we must act as individuals in a quest for excellence that will not be measured by new proposals or billions in new funding. rather, it involves an expenditure of american spirit and just plain american grit.the congress will soon receive my comprehensive proposals to enhance our competitiveness — includinq new science and technology centers and strong new funding for basic research. (applause.)the bill will include legal and regulatory reforms and weapons to fight unfair trade practices. competitiveness also means giving our farmers a shot at participating fairly and fully in a changing world market.preparing for the future must begin, as always, with our children.we need to set for them new and more rigorous goals. we must demand more of ourselves and our children by raising literacy levels dramatically by the year 2000. our children should master the basic concepts of math and science, and let\\'s insist that students not leave high school until they have studied and understood the basic documents of our national heritage. (applause.)there\\'s one more thing we can\\'t let up on. let\\'s redouble our personal efforts to provide for every child a safe and drug_free learning environment. (applause.) if our crusade against drugs succeeds with our children, we will defeat that scourge all over the country.finally, let\\'s stop suppressing the spiritual core of our national being. our nation could not have been conceived without divine help. why is it that we can build a nation with our prayers but we can\\'t use a schoolroom for voluntary prayer? (applause.) the looth congress of the united states should be remembered as the one that ended the expulsion of god from america\\'s classrooms. (applause.)the quest for excellence into the 21st century begins in the schoolroom but must go next to the workplace. more than 20 million new jobs will be created before the new century unfolds, and, by then, our economy should be able to provide a job for everyone who wants to work.we must also enable our workers to adapt to the rapidly changing nature of the workplace, and i will propose substantial new federal commitments keyed to re-training and job mobility.over the next few weeks, i will be sending the congress a complete series of these special messages — on budget reform, welfare reform, competitiveness, including education, trade, worker training and assistance, agriculture, and other subjects.the congress can give us these tools, but to make these tools work, it really comes down to just beinq our best, and that is the core of american greatness.the responsibility of freedom presses us towards higher knowledge and, i believe, moral and spiritual greatness. through lower taxes and smaller government, government has its ways of freeing people\\'s spirits. but only we, each of us, can let the spirit soar against our own individual standards. excellence is what makes frcedom ring. and isn\\'t that what we do best?we\\'re entering our third century now, but it\\'s wrong to judge our nation by its years. the calendar can\\'t measure america because we were meant to be an endless experiment in freedom with no limit to our reaches, no boundaries to what we can do, no end point to our hopes.the united states constitution is the impassioned and inspired vehicle by which we travel through history. it grew out of the most fundamental inspiration of our existence: that we are here to serve him by living free — that living free releases in us the noblest of impulses and the best of our abilities. that we would use these gifts for good and generous purposes and would secure them not just for ourselves, and for our children, but for all mankind. (applause.)over the years — i won\\'t count if you don\\'t nothing has been so heartwarming to me as speaking to america\\'s young. and the little ones especially so fresh-faced and so eager to know -well, from time to time i\\'ve been with them, they will ask about our constitution, and i hope you members of congress will not deem this a breach of protocol if you\\'ll permit me to share these thoughts again with the young people who might be listening or watching this evening.i have read the constitutions of a number of countries including the soviet union\\'s. now some people are surprised to hear that they have a constitution, and it even supposedly grants a number of freedoms to its people. many countries have written into their constitution provisions for freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. well, if this is true, why is the constitution of the united states so exceptional?well, the difference is so small that it almost escapes you - but it\\'s so great it tells you the whole story in just three words: we the people. in those other constitutions, the government tells the people of those countries what they are allowed to do. in our constitution, we the people tell the government what it can do and that it can do only those things listed in that document and no others.virtually every other revolution in history has just exchanged one set of rulers for another set of rulers. our revolution is the first to say the people are the masters, and government is their servant. (applause.)and you young people out there, don\\'t ever forget that. some day, you could be in this room — but wherever you are, america is depending on you to reach your highest and be your best because here, in america, we the people are in charge.just three words. we the people. those are the kids on christmas day looking out from a frozen sentry post on the 38th parallel in korea, or aboard an aircraft carrier in the mediterranean. a million miles from home. but doing their duty.we the people. those are the warm-hearted whose numbers we can\\'t begin to count who\\'ll begin the day with a little prayer for hostages they will never know and mia families they will never meet. why? because that\\'s the way we are, this unique breed we call americans.we the people. they\\'re farmers on tough times, but who never stop feeding a hungry world. they\\'re the volunteers at the hospital choking back their tears for the hundredth time, caring for a baby strugling for life because of a mother who used drugs. and you\\'ll forgive me a special memory — it\\'s a million mothers like nelle reagan who never knew a stranger or turned a hungry person away from her kitchen door.we the people. they refute last week\\'s television commentary downgrading our optimism and our idealism. they are the entrepreneurs, the builders, the pioneers, and a lot of regular folks the true heroes of our land who make up the most uncommon nation of doers in history. you know they\\'re americans because their spirit is as big as the universe and their hearts are bigger than their spirits.we the people. starting the third century of a dream and standing up to some cynic who\\'s trying to tell us we\\'re not going to get any better.are we at the end? well, i can\\'t tell it any better than the real thing — a story recorded by james madison from the final moments of the constitutional convention — september 17th, 1787. as the last few members signed the document, benjamin franklin— the oldest delegate at 81 years, and in frail health — looked over toward the chair where george washington  daily presided. at the back of the chair was painted the picture of a sun on the horizon. and turning to those sitting next to him, franklin observed that artists found it difficult in their painting to distinguish between a rising and a setting sun.well, i know if we were there, we could see those delegates sitting around  franklin — leaning in to listen more closely to him. and then dr. franklin began to share his deepest hopes and fears about the outcome of their efforts, and this is what he said: \"i have often looked at that picture behind the president without being able to tell whether it was a rising or setting sun: but now at length i have the happiness to know that it is a rising and not a setting sun.\"well, you can bet it\\'s rising, because, my fellow citizens, america  isn\\'t finished her best days have just begun.thank you, god bless you and god bless america. (applause.)'\n",
      " '\"thank you. mr. speaker, mr. president, and distinguished members of the house and senate, when we first met here seven years ago — many of us for the first time — it was with the hope or beginning something new for america. we meet here tonight in this historic chamber to continue that work. if anyone expects just a proud recitation of the accomplishments of my administration, i say let\\'s leave that to history: we\\'re not finished yet. (applause.) so my message to you tonight is, put on your work shoes — we\\'re still on the job. (applause.)history records the power of the ideas that brought us here those seven years ago. ideas like the individual\\'s right to reach as far and as high as his or her talents will permit, the free market as an engine of economic progress and, as an ancient chinese philosopher, lao-tzu, said, \"govern a great nation as you would cook a small fish; do not overdo it.\"well, these ideas were part of a larger notion — a vision, if you will, of america herself — an america not only rich in opportunity for the individual but an america, too, of strong families and vibrant neighborhoods, an america whose divergent but harmonizing communities were a reflection of a deeper community of values — the value of work, of family, of religion — and of the love of freedom that god places in each of us and whose defense he has entrusted in a special way to this nation.all of this was made possible by an idea i spoke of when mr. gorbachev was here — the belief that the most exciting revolution ever known to humankind began with three simple words: \"we the people\" — the revolutionary notion that the people grant government its rights, and not the other way around.and there is one lesson that has come home powerfully to me, which i would offer to you now. just as those who created this republic pledged to each other their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor, so, too, america\\'s leaders today must pledge to each other that we will keep foremost in our hearts and minds not what is best for ourselves or for our party, but what is best for america. (applause.) in the spirit of jefferson, let us affirm that, in this chamber tonight, there are no republicans, no democrats, just americans.yes, we will have our differences. but let us always remember — what unites us far outweighs whatever divides us. those who sent us here to serve them — the millions of americans watching and listening tonight — expect this of us. let\\'s prove to them and to ourselves that democracy works even in an election year.we have done this before. and as we have worked together to bring down spending, tax rates, and inflation, employment has climbed to record heights; america has created more jobs and better, higher-paying jobs; family income has risen for four straight years, and america\\'s poor climbed out of poverty at the fastest rate in more than 10 years. (applause.) our record is not just the longest peacetime expansion in history, but an economic and social revolution of hope, based on work, incentives, growth and opportunity; a revolution of compassion that led to private sector initiatives and a 77 percent increase in charitable giving; a revolution that — at a critical moment in world history — reclaimed and restored the american dream.in international relations, too, there\\'s only one description for what, together, we have achieved — a complete turnabout, a revolution. seven years ago, america was weak and freedom everywhere was under siege. today america is strong and democracy is everywhere on the move. from central america to east asia, ideas like free markets and democratic reforms and human rights are taking hold. we\\'ve replaced \"blame america\" with \"look up to america.\" (applause.) we\\'ve rebuilt our defenses, and, of all our accomplishments, none can give us more satisfaction than knowing that our young people are again proud to wear our country\\'s uniform. (applause.) and in a few moments, i\\'m going to talk about three development — arms reduction, the strategic defense initiative, and the global democratic revolution — that, when taken together, offer a chance none of us would have dared imagine seven years ago, a chance to rid the world of the two great nightmares of the postwar era. i speak of the startling hope of giving our children a future free of both totalitarianism and nuclear terror.tonight, then, we\\'re strong, prosperous, at peace, and we are free. this is the state of our union. and if we will work together this year, i believe we can give a future president and a future congress the chance to make that prosperity, that peace, that freedom, not just the state of our union, but the state of our world. (applause.)toward this end, we have four basic objectives tonight. first, steps we can take this year to keep our economy strong and growing, to give our children a future of low inflation and full employment. second, let\\'s check our progress in attacking social problems where important gains have been made but which still need critical attention. i mean schools that work, economic independence for the poor, restoring respect for family life and family values. our third objective tonight is global — continuing the exciting economic and democratic revolutions we\\'ve seen around the world. fourth and finally, our nation has remained at peace for nearly a decade and a half, as we move toward our goals of world prosperity and world freedom. we must protect that peace and deter war by making sure the next president inherits what you and i have a moral obligation to give that president — a national security that is unassailable and a national defense that takes full advantage of new technology, and is fully funded. applause.)this is a full agenda. it\\'s meant to be. you see, my thinking on the next year is quite simple — let\\'s make this the best of eight. and that means — (applause) — and that means it\\'s all out — right to the finish line. i don\\'t buy the idea that this is the last year of anything, because we\\'re not talking here tonight about registering temporary gains, but ways of making permanent our successes. and that\\'s why our focus is the values, the principles, and ideas that made america great. let\\'s be clear on this point — we\\'re for limited government because we understand, as the founding fathers did, that it is the best way of ensuring personal liberty and empowering the individual so that every american of every race and region shares fully in the flowering of american prosperity and freedom.one other thing we americans like — the future — like the sound of it, the idea of it, the hope of it. where others fear trade and economic growth, we see opportunities for creating new wealth and undreamed-of opportunities for millions in our own land and beyond. where others seek to throw up barriers, we seek to bring them down; where others take counsel of their fears, we follow our hopes. yes, we americans like the future and like making the most of it. let\\'s do that now.and let\\'s begin by discussing how to maintain economic growth by controlling and eventually eliminating the problem of federal deficits. we have had a balanced budget only eight times in the last 57 years. for the first time in 14 years, the federal government spent less in real terms last year than the year before. we took $73 billion off last year\\'s deficit compared to the year before. the deficit itself has moved from 6.3 percent of the gross national product to only 3.4 percent. and perhaps the most important sign of progress has been the change in our view of deficits. you know, a few of us can remember when, not too many years ago, those who created the deficits said they would make us prosperous and not to worry about the debt because \"we owe it to ourselves.\" well, at last there is agreement that we can\\'t spend ourselves rich.our recent budget agreement, designed to reduce federal deficits by $76 billion over the next two years, builds on this consensus. but this agreement must be adhered to without slipping into the errors of the past — more broken promises and more unchecked spending. as i indicated in my first state of the union, what ails us can be simply put: the federal government is too big and it spends too much money. (applause.) i can assure you, the bipartisan leadership of congress, of my help in fighting off any attempt to bust our budget agreement. and this includes the swift and certain use of the veto power.now, it is also time for some plain talk about the most immediate obstacle to controlling federal deficits. the simple but frustrating problem of making expenses match revenues — something american families do and the federal government can\\'t — has caused crisis after crisis in this city. mr. speaker, mr. president, i will say to you tonight what i have said before — and will continue to say: the budget process has broken down; it needs a drastic overhaul. (applause.) with each ensuing year, the spectacle before the american people is the same as it was this christmas — budget deadlines delayed or missed completely, monstrous continuing resolutions that pack hundreds of billions of dollars worth of spending into one bill — and a federal government on the brink of default.i know i\\'m echoing what you here in the congress have said because you suffered so directly — but let\\'s recall that in seven years, of 91 appropriations bills scheduled to arrive on my desk by a certain date, only 10 made it on time. last year, of the 13 appropriations bills due by october 1st, none of them made it. instead, we had four continuing resolutions lasting 41 days, then 36 days, and two days, and three days, respectively. and then, along came these behemoths. (applause.) this is the conference report — 1,053 page report weighing 14 pounds. then this — a reconciliation bill six months late, that was 1,186 pages long, weighing 15 pounds; and the long-term continuing resolution — (applause) — this one was two months late and it\\'s 1,057 pages long, weighing 14 pounds. that was a total of 43 pounds of paper and ink. you had three hours — yes, three hours — to consider each, and it took 300 people at my office of management and budget just to read the bill so the government wouldn\\'t shut down.congress shouldn\\'t send another one of these. (applause.) no — and if you do, i will not sign it. (applause.)let\\'s change all this; instead of a presidential budget that gets discarded and a congressional budget resolution that is not enforced, why not a simple partnership, a joint agreement that sets out the spending priorities within the available revenues? and let\\'s remember our deadline is october 1st, not christmas (applause); let\\'s get the people\\'s work done in time to avoid a footrace with santa claus. (laughter.) and yes, this year — to coin a phrase — a new beginning. thirteen individual bills, on time and fully reviewed by congress.i\\'m also certain you join me in saying: let\\'s help ensure our future of prosperity by giving the president a tool that — though i will not get use to use it — is one i know future presidents of either party must have. give the president the same authority that 43 governors use in their states, the right to reach into massive appropriation bills, pare away the waste, and enforce budget discipline. let\\'s approve the line-item veto. (applause.)and let\\'s take a partial step in this direction. most of you in this chamber didn\\'t know what was in this catch-all bill and report. over the past few weeks, we\\'ve all learned what was tucked away behind a little comma here and there. for example, there\\'s millions for items such as cranberry research, blueberry research, the study of crawfish, and the commercialization of wild flowers. and that\\'s not to mention the $5 million  or so — that — so that people from developing nations could come here to watch congress at work. (laughter.) i won\\'t even touch that. (laughter.) so tonight, i offer you this challenge. in 30 days, i will send back to you those items as rescissions, which if i had the authority to line them out, i would do so. (applause.)now, review this multibillion-dollar package that will not undercut our bipartisan budget agreement. as a matter of fact, if adopted, it will improve our deficit reduction goals. and what an example we can set; that we\\'re serious about getting our financial accounts in order. by acting and approving this plan, you have the opportunity to override a congressional process that is out of control.there is another vital reform. yes, gramm-rudman-hollings has been profoundly helpful, but let us take its goal of a balanced budget and make it permanent. let us do now what so many states do to hold down spending and what 32 state legislatures have asked us to do; let us heed the wishes of an overwhelming plurality of americans and pass a constitutional amendment that mandates a balanced budget and forces the federal government to live within its means. (applause.)reform of the budget process — including the line-item veto and balanced budget amendment — will, together with real restraint on government spending, prevent the federal budget from ever again ravaging the family budget.let\\'s ensure that the federal government never again legislates against the family and the home. last september, i signed an executive order on the family requiring that every department and agency review its activities in light of seven standards designed to promote and not harm the family. but let us make certain that the family is always at the center of the public policy process, not just in this administration but in future — all future administrations. it\\'s time for congress to consider — at the beginning — a statement of the impact that legislation will have on the basic unit of american society, the family.and speaking of the family, let\\'s turn to a matter on the mind of every american parent tonight — education. we all know the sorry story of the 60s and 70s — soaring spending, plummeting test scores — and that hopeful trend of the 80s, when we replaced an obsession with dollars with a commitment to quality, and test scores started back up. there\\'s a lesson here that we all should write on the blackboard 100 times — in a child\\'s education, money can never take the place of basics like discipline, hard work, and, yes, homework. (applause.)as a nation we do, of course, spend heavily on education — more than we spend on defense — yet across our country, governors like new jersey\\'s tom kean are giving classroom demonstrations that how we spend is as important as how much we spend. opening up the teaching profession to all qualified candidates, merit pay, so that good teachers get a\\'s as well as apples, and stronger curriculum, as secretary bennett has proposed for high schools. these imaginative reforms are making common sense the most popular new kid in america\\'s schools.how can we help? well, we can talk about and push for these reforms. but the most important thing we can do is to reaffirm that control of our schools belongs to the states, local communities and, most of all, to the parents and teachers. (applause.)my friends, some years ago, the federal government declared war on poverty, and poverty won. (laughter.) today, the federal government has 59 major welfare programs and spends more than $100 billion a year on them. what has all this money done?well, too often it has only made poverty harder to escape. federal welfare programs have created a massive social problem. with the best of intentions, government created a poverty trap that wreaks havoc on the very support system the poor need most to lift themselves out of poverty — the family. dependency has become the one enduring heirloom, passed from one generation to the next, of too many fragmented families.it is time — this may be the most radical thing i\\'ve said in seven years in this office — it\\'s time for washington to show a little humility. there are a thousand sparks of genius in 50 states and a thousand communities around the nation. it is time to nurture them and see which ones can catch fire and become guiding lights.states have begun to show us the way. they have demonstrated that successful welfare programs can be built around more effective child support enforcement practices and innovative programs requiring welfare recipients to work or prepare for work. (applause.)let us give the states even more flexibility and encourage more reforms.let\\'s start making our welfare system the first rung on america\\'s ladder of opportunity — a boost up from dependency; not a graveyard, but a birthplace of hope.and now let me turn to three other matters vital to family values and the quality of family life. the first is an untold american success story. recently, we released our annual survey of what graduating high school seniors have to say about drugs. cocaine use is declining and marijuana use was the lowest since surveying began. we can be proud that our students are \"just saying no\" to drugs. (applause.) but let us remember what this menace requires — commitment from every part of america and every single american — a commitment to a drug-free america. the war against drugs is a war of individual battles, a crusade with many heroes — including america\\'s young people, and also someone very special to me. she has helped so many of our young people to say \"no\" to drugs. nancy, much credit belongs to you, and i want to express to you your husband\\'s pride and your country\\'s thanks. (applause.) surprised you, didn\\'t i? (laughter.)well now, we come to a family issue that we must have the courage to confront. tonight, i call america — a good nation, a moral people — to charitable but realistic consideration of the terrible cost of abortion on demand. to those who say this violates a woman\\'s right to control of her own body — can they deny that now medical evidence confirms the unborn child is a living human being entitled to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness? (applause.) let us unite as a nation and protect the unborn with legislation that would stop all federal funding for abortion — and with a human life amendment making, of course, an exception where the unborn child threatens the life of the mother. our judeo-christian tradition recognizes the right of taking a life in self-defense.but with that one exception, let us look to those others in our land who cry out for children to adopt. i pledge to you tonight, i will work to remove barriers to adoption and extend full sharing in family life to millions of americans, so that children who need homes can be welcomed to families who want them and love them. (applause.)and let me add here: so many of our greatest statesmen have reminded us that spiritual values alone are essential to our nation\\'s health and vigor. the congress opens its proceedings each day, as does the supreme court, with an acknowledgment of the supreme being — yet we are denied the right to set aside in our schools a moment each day for those who wish to pray. i believe congress should pass our school prayer amendment. (applause.)now, to make sure there is a full nine-member supreme court to interpret the law, to protect the rights of all americans, i urge the senate to move quickly and decisively in confirming judge anthony kennedy to the highest court in the land and to also confirm 27 nominees now waiting to fill vacancies in the federal judiciary. (applause.)here then are our domestic priorities; yet if the congress and the administration work together, even greater opportunities lie ahead to expand a growing world economy; to continue to reduce the threat of nuclear arms and to extend the frontiers of freedom and the growth of democratic institutions.our policies consistently received the strongest support of the late congressman dan daniel of virginia. i\\'m sure all of you join me in expressing heartfelt condolences on his passing.one of the greatest contributions the united states can make to the world is to promote freedom as the key to economic growth. a creative, competitive america is the answer to a changing world, not trade wars that would close doors, create greater barriers, and destroy millions of jobs. we should always remember: protectionism is destructionism. america\\'s jobs, america\\'s growth, america\\'s future depend on trade — trade that is free, open, and fair. (applause.)this year, we have it within our power to take a major step toward a growing global economy and an expanding cycle of prosperity that reaches to all the free nations of this earth. i\\'m speaking of the historic free trade agreement negotiated between our country and canada. and i can also tell you that we\\'re determined to expand this concept, south as well as north. next month i will be traveling to mexico where trade matters will be of foremost concern. and, over the next several months, our congress and the canadian parliament can make the start of such a north american accord a reality. our goal must be a day when the free flow of trade — from the tip of tierra del fuego to the arctic circle — unites the people of the western hemisphere in a bond of mutually beneficial exchange; when all borders become what the u.s.-canadian border so long has been — a meeting place, rather than a dividing line. (applause.)this movement we see in so many places toward economic freedom is indivisible from the worldwide movement toward political freedom — and against totalitarian rule. this global democratic revolution has removed the specter — so frightening a decade ago — of democracy doomed to permanent minority status in the world. in south and central america, only a third of the people enjoyed democratic rule in 1976. today, over 90 percent of latin americans live in nations committed to democratic principles.and the resurgence of democracy is owed to these courageous people on almost every continent who have struggled to take control of their own destiny. in nicaragua, the struggle has extra meaning because that nation is so near our own borders. the recent revelations of a former high-level sandinista major, roger miranda, show us that, even as they talk peace, the communist sandinista government of nicaragua has established plans for a large 600,000-man army. yet even as these plans are made, the sandinista regime knows the tide is turning and the cause of nicaraguan freedom is riding at its crest. because of the freedom fighters, who are resisting communist rule, the sandinistas have been forced to extend some democratic rights, negotiate with church authorities, and release a few political prisoners.the focus is on the sandinistas, their promises and their actions. there is a consensus among the four central american democratic presidents that the sandinistas have not complied with the plan to bring peace and democracy to all of central america. the sandinistas again have promised reforms. their challenge is to take irreversible steps toward democracy.on wednesday, my request to sustain the freedom fighters will be submitted which reflects our mutual desire for peace, freedom, and democracy in nicaragua. i ask congress to pass this request — let us be for the people of nicaragua what lafayette, pulaski, and von steuben were for our forefathers and the cause of american independence. (applause.)so, too, in afghanistan, the freedom fighters are the key to peace. we support the mujahadeen. there can be no settlement unless all soviet troops are removed and the afghan people are allowed genuine self-determination. (applause.) i have made my views on this matter known to mr. gorbachev. but not just nicaragua or afghanistan. yes, everywhere we see a swelling freedom tide across the world — freedom fighters rising up in cambodia and angola, fighting and dying for the same democratic liberties we hold sacred. their cause is our cause. freedom.yet, even as we work to expand world freedom, we must build a safer peace and reduce the danger of nuclear war. but let\\'s have no illusions. three years of steady decline in the value of our annual defense investment have increased the risk of our most basic security interests, jeopardizing earlier hard-won goals. we must face squarely the implications of this negative trend and make adequate, stable defense spending a top goal both this year and in the future. this same concern applies to economic and security assistance programs as well. but the resolve of america and its nato allies has opened the way for unprecedented achievement in arms reduction. our recently signed inf treaty is historic because it reduces nuclear arms and establishes the most stringent verification regime in arms control history, including several forms of short-notice, on-site inspection. i submitted the treaty today, and i urge the senate to give its advice and consent to ratification of this landmark agreement. (applause.) thank you very much.in addition to the inf treaty, we\\'re within reach of an even more significant start agreement that will reduce u.s. and soviet long-range missile or strategic arsenals by half. but let me be clear — our approach is not to seek agreement for agreement\\'s sake, but to settle only for agreements that truly enhance our national security and that of our allies. we will never put our security at risk — or that of our allies — just to reach an agreement with the soviets. (applause.) no agreement is better than a bad agreement. (applause.)as i mentioned earlier, our efforts are to give future generations what we never had — a future free of nuclear terror. reduction of strategic offensive arms is one step. sdi another. our funding request for our strategic defense initiative is less than two percent of the total defense budget. sdi funding is money wisely appropriated and money well spent. (applause.) sdi has the same purpose and supports the same goals of arms reduction. it reduces the risk of war and the threat of nuclear weapons to all mankind. strategic defenses that threaten no one could offer the world a safer, more stable basis for deterrence. we must also remember that sdi is our insurance policy against a nuclear accident — a chernobyl of the sky — or an accidental launch, or some madman who might come along.we\\'ve seen such changes in the world in seven years — as totalitarianism struggles to avoid being overwhelmed by the forces of economic advance and the aspiration for human freedom, it is the free nations that are resilient and resurgent. as the global democratic revolution has put totalitarianism on the defensive, we have left behind the days of retreat — america is again a vigorous leader of the free world, a nation that acts decisively and firmly in the furtherance of her principles and vital interests. no legacy would make me more proud than leaving in place a bipartisan consensus for the cause of world freedom, a consensus that prevents a paralysis of american power from ever occurring again. (applause.)but my thoughts tonight go beyond this. and i hope you\\'ll let me end this evening with a personal reflection. you know, the world could never be quite the same again after jacob shallus, a trustworthy and dependable clerk of the pennsylvania general assembly, took his pen and engrossed those words about representative government in the preamble of our constitution. and in a quiet but final way, the course of human events was forever altered when, on a ridge overlooking the emmitsburg pike in an obscure pennsylvania town called gettysburg, lincoln spoke of our duty to government of and by the people and never letting it perish from the earth.at the start of this decade, i suggested that we lived in equally momentous times — that it is up to us now to decide whether our form of government would endure and whether history still had a place of greatness for a quiet, pleasant, greening land called america. not everything has been made perfect in seven years — nor will it be made perfect in seven times 70 years — but before us, this year and beyond, are great prospects for the cause of peace and world freedom.it means, too, that the young americans i spoke of seven years ago, as well as those who might be coming along the virginia or maryland shores this night and seeing for the first time the lights of this capital city, the lights that cast their glow on our great halls of government and the monuments to the memory of our great men — it means those young americans will find a city of hope in a land that is free.we can be proud that for them and for us as those lights along the potomac are still seen this night — signaling, as they have for nearly two centuries and as we pray god they always will, that another generation of americans has protected and passed on lovingly this place called america, this shining city on a hill, this government of, by, and for the people.thank you and god bless you.\" (applause.)'\n",
      " \"mr. speaker and mr. president, distinguished members of congress, honored guests, and fellow citizens: thank you very much for that warm reception. you know, with the big buildup this address has had, i wanted to make sure it would be a big hit, but i couldn't convince barbara to deliver it for me. [laughter] i see the speaker and the vice president are laughing. they saw what i did in japan, and they're just happy they're sitting behind me. [laughter] i mean to speak tonight of big things, of big changes and the promises they hold, and of some big problems and how, together, we can solve them and move our country forward as the undisputed leader of the age. we gather tonight at a dramatic and deeply promising time in our history and in the history of man on earth. for in the past 12 months, the world has known changes of almost biblical proportions. and even now, months after the failed coup that doomed a failed system, i'm not sure we've absorbed the full impact, the full import of what happened. but communism died this year. even as president, with the most fascinating possible vantage point, there were times when i was so busy managing progress and helping to lead change that i didn't always show the joy that was in my heart. but the biggest thing that has happened in the world in my life, in our lives, is this: by the grace of god, america won the cold war. i mean to speak this evening of the changes that can take place in our country, now that we can stop making the sacrifices we had to make when we had an avowed enemy that was a superpower. now we can look homeward even more and move to set right what needs to be set right. i will speak of those things. but let me tell you something i've been thinking these past few months. it's a kind of rollcall of honor. for the cold war didn't end; it was won. and i think of those who won it, in places like korea and vietnam. and some of them didn't come back. back then they were heroes, but this year they were victors. the long rollcall, all the g.i. joes and janes, all the ones who fought faithfully for freedom, who hit the ground and sucked the dust and knew their share of horror. this may seem frivolous, and i don't mean it so, but it's moving to me how the world saw them. the world saw not only their special valor but their special style: their rambunctious, optimistic bravery, their do-or-die unity unhampered by class or race or region. what a group we've put forth, for generations now, from the ones who wrote ``kilroy was here on the walls of the german stalags to those who left signs in the iraqi desert that said, ``i saw elvis. what a group of kids we've sent out into the world. and there's another to be singled out, though it may seem inelegant, and i mean a mass of people called the american taxpayer. no one ever thinks to thank the people who pay a country's bill or an alliance's bill. but for half a century now, the american people have shouldered the burden and paid taxes that were higher than they would have been to support a defense that was bigger than it would have been if imperial communism had never existed. but it did; doesn't anymore. and here's a fact i wouldn't mind the world acknowledging: the american taxpayer bore the brunt of the burden and deserves a hunk of the glory. so now, for the first time in 35 years, our strategic bombers stand down. no longer are they on 'round-the-clock alert. tomorrow our children will go to school and study history and how plants grow. and they won't have, as my children did, air raid drills in which they crawl under their desks and cover their heads in case of nuclear war. my grandchildren don't have to do that and won't have the bad dreams children had once, in decades past. there are still threats. but the long, drawn-out dread is over. a year ago tonight, i spoke to you at a moment of high peril. american forces had just unleashed operation desert storm. and after 40 days in the desert skies and 4 days on the ground, the men and women of america's armed forces and our allies accomplished the goals that i declared and that you endorsed: we liberated kuwait. soon after, the arab world and israel sat down to talk seriously and comprehensively about peace, an historic first. and soon after that, at christmas, the last american hostages came home. our policies were vindicated. much good can come from the prudent use of power. and much good can come of this: a world once divided into two armed camps now recognizes one sole and preeminent power, the united states of america. and they regard this with no dread. for the world trusts us with power, and the world is right. they trust us to be fair and restrained. they trust us to be on the side of decency. they trust us to do what's right. i use those words advisedly. a few days after the war began, i received a telegram from joanne speicher, the wife of the first pilot killed in the gulf, lieutenant commander scott speicher. even in her grief, she wanted me to know that some day when her children were old enough, she would tell them ``that their father went away to war because it was the right thing to do. and she said it all: it was the right thing to do. and we did it together. there were honest differences right here in this chamber. but when the war began, you put partisanship aside, and we supported our troops. this is still a time for pride, but this is no time to boast. for problems face us, and we must stand together once again and solve them and not let our country down. two years ago, i began planning cuts in military spending that reflected the changes of the new era. but now, this year, with imperial communism gone, that process can be accelerated. tonight i can tell you of dramatic changes in our strategic nuclear force. these are actions we are taking on our own because they are the right thing to do. after completing 20 planes for which we have begun procurement, we will shut down further production of the b - 2 bombers. we will cancel the small icbm program. we will cease production of new warheads for our sea-based ballistic missiles. we will stop all new production of the peacekeeper missile. and we will not purchase any more advanced cruise missiles. this weekend i will meet at camp david with boris yeltsin of the russian federation. i've informed president yeltsin that if the commonwealth, the former soviet union, will eliminate all land-based multiple-warhead ballistic missiles, i will do the following: we will eliminate all peacekeeper missiles. we will reduce the number of warheads on minuteman missiles to one and reduce the number of warheads on our sea-based missiles by about one-third. and we will convert a substantial portion of our strategic bombers to primarily conventional use. president yeltsin's early response has been very positive, and i expect our talks at camp david to be fruitful. i want you to know that for half a century, american presidents have longed to make such decisions and say such words. but even in the midst of celebration, we must keep caution as a friend. for the world is still a dangerous place. only the dead have seen the end of conflict. and though yesterday's challenges are behind us, tomorrow's are being born. the secretary of defense recommended these cuts after consultation with the joint chiefs of staff. and i make them with confidence. but do not misunderstand me. the reductions i have approved will save us an additional $50 billion over the next 5 years. by 1997, we will have cut defense by 30 percent since i took office. these cuts are deep, and you must know my resolve: this deep, and no deeper. to do less would be insensible to progress, but to do more would be ignorant of history. we must not go back to the days of ``the hollow army. we cannot repeat the mistakes made twice in this century when armistice was followed by recklessness and defense was purged as if the world were permanently safe. i remind you this evening that i have asked for your support in funding a program to protect our country from limited nuclear missile attack. we must have this protection because too many people in too many countries have access to nuclear arms. and i urge you again to pass the strategic defense initiative, sdi. there are those who say that now we can turn away from the world, that we have no special role, no special place. but we are the united states of america, the leader of the west that has become the leader of the world. and as long as i am president, i will continue to lead in support of freedom everywhere, not out of arrogance, not out of altruism, but for the safety and security of our children. this is a fact: strength in the pursuit of peace is no vice; isolationism in the pursuit of security is no virtue. and now to our troubles at home. they're not all economic; the primary problem is our economy. there are some good signs. inflation, that thief, is down. and interest rates are down. but unemployment is too high, some industries are in trouble, and growth is not what it should be. let me tell you right from the start and right from the heart, i know we're in hard times. but i know something else: this will not stand. in this chamber, in this chamber we can bring the same courage and sense of common purpose to the economy that we brought to desert storm. and we can defeat hard times together. i believe you'll help. one reason is that you're patriots, and you want the best for your country. and i believe that in your hearts you want to put partisanship aside and get the job done because it's the right thing to do. the power of america rests in a stirring but simple idea, that people will do great things if only you set them free. well, we're going to set the economy free. for if this age of miracles and wonders has taught us anything, it's that if we can change the world we can change america. we must encourage investment. we must make it easier for people to invest money and create new products, new industries, and new jobs. we must clear away the obstacles to growth: high taxes, high regulation, redtape, and yes, wasteful government spending. none of this will happen with a snap of the fingers, but it will happen. and the test of a plan isn't whether it's called new or dazzling. the american people aren't impressed by gimmicks; they're smarter on this score than all of us in this room. the only test of a plan is: is it sound, and will it work? we must have a short-term plan to address our immediate needs and heat up the economy. and then we need a longer term plan to keep combustion going and to guarantee our place in the world economy. there are certain things that a president can do without congress, and i'm going to do them. i have, this evening, asked major cabinet departments and federal agencies to institute a 90-day moratorium on any new federal regulations that could hinder growth. in those 90 days, major departments and agencies will carry out a top-to-bottom review of all regulations, old and new, to stop the ones that will hurt growth and speed up those that will help growth. further, for the untold number of hard-working, responsible american workers and business men and women who've been forced to go without needed bank loans, the banking credit crunch must end. i won't neglect my responsibility for sound regulations that serve the public good, but regulatory overkill must be stopped. and i've instructed our government regulators to stop it. i have directed cabinet departments and federal agencies to speed up progrowth expenditures as quickly as possible. this should put an extra $10 billion into the economy in the next 6 months. and our new transportation bill provides more than $150 billion for construction and maintenance projects that are vital to our growth and well-being. and that means jobs building roads, jobs building bridges, and jobs building railways. and i have, this evening, directed the secretary of the treasury to change the federal tax withholding tables. with this change, millions of americans from whom the government withholds more than necessary can now choose to have the government withhold less from their paychecks. something tells me a number of taxpayers may take us up on this one. this initiative could return about $25 billion back into our economy over the next 12 months, money people can use to help pay for clothing, college, or to get a new car. finally, working with the federal reserve, we will continue to support monetary policy that keeps both interest rates and inflation down. now, these are the things i can do. and now, members of congress, let me tell you what you can do for your country. you must pass the other elements of my plan to meet our economic needs. everyone knows that investment spurs recovery. i am proposing this evening a change in the alternative minimum tax and the creation of a new 15-percent investment tax allowance. this will encourage businesses to accelerate investment and bring people back to work. real estate has led our economy out of almost all the tough times we've ever had. once building starts, carpenters and plumbers work; people buy homes and take out mortgages. my plan would modify the passive loss rule for active real estate developers. and it would make it easier for pension plans to purchase real estate. for those americans who dream of buying a first home but who can't quite afford it, my plan would allow first-time homebuyers to withdraw savings from ira's without penalty and provide a $5,000 tax credit for the first purchase of that home. and finally, my immediate plan calls on congress to give crucial help to people who own a home, to everyone who has a business or a farm or a single investment. this time, at this hour, i cannot take no for an answer. you must cut the capital gains tax on the people of our country. never has an issue been more demagogued by its opponents. but the demagogs are wrong. they are wrong, and they know it. sixty percent of the people who benefit from lower capital gains have incomes under $50,000. a cut in the capital gains tax increases jobs and helps just about everyone in our country. and so, i'm asking you to cut the capital gains tax to a maximum of 15.4 percent. i'll tell you, those of you who say, ``oh, no, someone who's comfortable may benefit from that, you kind of remind me of the old definition of the puritan who couldn't sleep at night, worrying that somehow, someone somewhere was out having a good time. [laughter] the opponents of this measure and those who have authored various so-called soak-the-rich bills that are floating around this chamber should be reminded of something: when they aim at the big guy, they usually hit the little guy. and maybe it's time that stopped. this, then, is my short-term plan. your part, members of congress, requires enactment of these commonsense proposals that will have a strong effect on the economy without breaking the budget agreement and without raising tax rates. while my plan is being passed and kicking in, we've got to care for those in trouble today. i have provided for up to $4.4 billion in my budget to extend federal unemployment benefits. and i ask for congressional action right away. and i thank the committee. [applause] well, at last. let's be frank. let's be frank. let me level with you. i know and you know that my plan is unveiled in a political season. [laughter] i know and you know that everything i propose will be viewed by some in merely partisan terms. but i ask you to know what is in my heart. and my aim is to increase our nation's good. i'm doing what i think is right, and i am proposing what i know will help. i pride myself that i'm a prudent man, and i believe that patience is a virtue. but i understand that politics is, for some, a game and that sometimes the game is to stop all progress and then decry the lack of improvement. [laughter] but let me tell you: far more important than my political future and far more important than yours is the well-being of our country. members of this chamber are practical people, and i know you won't resent some practical advice. when people put their party's fortunes, whatever the party, whatever side of this aisle, before the public good, they court defeat not only for their country but for themselves. and they will certainly deserve it. i submit my plan tomorrow, and i'm asking you to pass it by march 20th. and i ask the american people to let you know they want this action by march 20th. from the day after that, if it must be, the battle is joined. and you know, when principle is at stake i relish a good, fair fight. i said my plan has two parts, and it does. and it's the second part that is the heart of the matter. for it's not enough to get an immediate burst. we need long-term improvement in our economic position. we all know that the key to our economic future is to ensure that america continues as an economic leader of the world. we have that in our power. here, then, is my long-term plan to guarantee our future. first, trade: we will work to break down the walls that stop world trade. we will work to open markets everywhere. and in our major trade negotiations, i will continue pushing to eliminate tariffs and subsidies that damage america's farmers and workers. and we'll get more good american jobs within our own hemisphere through the north american free trade agreement and through the enterprise for the americas initiative. but changes are here, and more are coming. the workplace of the future will demand more highly skilled workers than ever, more people who are computer-literate, highly educated. we must be the world's leader in education. and we must revolutionize america's schools. my america 2000 strategy will help us reach that goal. my plan will give parents more choice, give teachers more flexibility, and help communities create new american schools. thirty states across the nation have established america 2000 programs. hundreds of cities and towns have joined in. now congress must join this great movement: pass my proposals for new american schools. that was my second long-term proposal, and here's my third: we must make commonsense investments that will help us compete, long-term, in the marketplace. we must encourage research and development. my plan is to make the r&d tax credit permanent and to provide record levels of support, over $76 billion this year alone, for people who will explore the promise of emerging technologies. fourth, we must do something about crime and drugs. it is time for a major, renewed investment in fighting violent street crime. it saps our strength and hurts our faith in our society and in our future together. surely a tired woman on her way to work at 6 in the morning on a subway deserves the right to get there safely. and surely it's true that everyone who changes his or her life because of crime, from those afraid to go out at night to those afraid to walk in the parks they pay for, surely these people have been denied a basic civil right. it is time to restore it. congress, pass my comprehensive crime bill. it is tough on criminals and supportive of police, and it has been languishing in these hallowed halls for years now. pass it. help your country. fifth, i ask you tonight to fund our hope housing proposal and to pass my enterprise zone legislation which will get businesses into the inner city. we must empower the poor with the pride that comes from owning a home, getting a job, becoming a part of things. my plan would encourage real estate construction by extending tax incentives for mortgage revenue bonds and low-income housing. and i ask tonight for record expenditures for the program that helps children born into want move into excellence, head start. step six, we must reform our health care system. for this, too, bears on whether or not we can compete in the world. american health costs have been exploding. this year america will spend over $800 billion on health, and that is expected to grow to 1.6 trillion by the end of the decade. we simply cannot afford this. the cost of health care shows up not only in your family budget but in the price of everything we buy and everything we sell. when health coverage for a fellow on an assembly line costs thousands of dollars, the cost goes into the products he makes, and you pay the bill. we must make a choice. now, some pretend we can have it both ways. they call it ``play or pay, but that expensive approach is unstable. it will mean higher taxes, fewer jobs, and eventually a system under complete government control. really, there are only two options. and we can move toward a nationalized system, a system which will restrict patient choice in picking a doctor and force the government to ration services arbitrarily. and what we'll get is patients in long lines, indifferent service, and a huge new tax burden. or we can reform our own private health care system, which still gives us, for all its flaws, the best quality health care in the world. well, let's build on our strengths. my plan provides insurance security for all americans while preserving and increasing the idea of choice. we make basic health insurance affordable for all low-income people not now covered, and we do it by providing a health insurance tax credit of up to $3,750 for each low-income family. and the middle class gets help, too. and by reforming the health insurance market, my plan assures that americans will have access to basic health insurance even if they change jobs or develop serious health problems. we must bring costs under control, preserve quality, preserve choice, and reduce the people's nagging daily worry about health insurance. my plan, the details of which i'll announce very shortly, does just that. seventh, we must get the federal deficit under control. we now have, in law, enforceable spending caps and a requirement that we pay for the programs we create. there are those in congress who would ease that discipline now. but i cannot let them do it, and i won't. my plan would freeze all domestic discretionary budget authority, which means no more next year than this year. i will not tamper with social security, but i would put real caps on the growth of uncontrolled spending. and i would also freeze federal domestic government employment. and with the help of congress, my plan will get rid of 246 programs that don't deserve federal funding. some of them have noble titles, but none of them is indispensable. we can get rid of each and every one of them. you know, it's time we rediscovered a home truth the american people have never forgotten: this government is too big and spends too much. and i call upon congress to adopt a measure that will help put an end to the annual ritual of filling the budget with pork barrel appropriations. every year, the press has a field day making fun of outrageous examples: a lawrence welk museum, research grants for belgian endive. we all know how these things get into the budget, and maybe you need someone to help you say no. i know how to say it, and i know what i need to make it stick. give me the same thing 43 governors have, the line-item veto, and let me help you control spending. we must put an end to unfinanced federal government mandates. these are the requirements congress puts on our cities, counties, and states without supplying the money. if congress passes a mandate, it should be forced to pay for it and balance the cost with savings elsewhere. after all, a mandate just increases someone else's burden, and that means higher taxes at the state and local level. step eight, congress should enact the bold reform proposals that are still awaiting congressional action: bank reform, civil justice reform, tort reform, and my national energy strategy. and finally, we must strengthen the family because it is the family that has the greatest bearing on our future. when barbara holds an aids baby in her arms and reads to children, she's saying to every person in this country: family matters. and i am announcing tonight a new commission on america's urban families. i've asked missouri's governor john ashcroft to be chairman, former dallas mayor annette strauss to be cochair. you know, i had mayors, the leading mayors from the league of cities, in the other day at the white house, and they told me something striking. they said that every one of them, republican or democrat, agreed on one thing, that the major cause of the problems of the cities is the dissolution of the family. they asked for this commission, and they were right to ask because it's time to determine what we can do to keep families together, strong and sound. there's one thing we can do right away: ease the burden of rearing a child. i ask you tonight to raise the personal exemption by $500 per child for every family. for a family with four kids, that's an increase of $2,000. this is a good start in the right direction, and it's what we can afford. it's time to allow families to deduct the interest they pay on student loans. i am asking you to do just that. and i'm asking you to allow people to use money from their ira's to pay medical and education expenses, all without penalties. and i'm asking for more. ask american parents what they dislike about how things are going in our country, and chances are good that pretty soon they'll get to welfare. americans are the most generous people on earth. but we have to go back to the insight of franklin roosevelt who, when he spoke of what became the welfare program, warned that it must not become ``a narcotic and a ``subtle destroyer of the spirit. welfare was never meant to be a lifestyle. it was never meant to be a habit. it was never supposed to be passed from generation to generation like a legacy. it's time to replace the assumptions of the welfare state and help reform the welfare system. states throughout the country are beginning to operate with new assumptions that when able-bodied people receive government assistance, they have responsibilities to the taxpayer: a responsibility to seek work, education, or job training; a responsibility to get their lives in order; a responsibility to hold their families together and refrain from having children out of wedlock; and a responsibility to obey the law. we are going to help this movement. often, state reform requires waiving certain federal regulations. i will act to make that process easier and quicker for every state that asks for our help. i want to add, as we make these changes, we work together to improve this system, that our intention is not scapegoating or finger-pointing. if you read the papers and watch tv, you know there's been a rise these days in a certain kind of ugliness: racist comments, anti-semitism, an increased sense of division. really, this is not us. this is not who we are. and this is not acceptable. and so, you have my plan for america. and i'm asking for big things, but i believe in my heart you'll do what's right. you know, it's kind of an american tradition to show a certain skepticism toward our democratic institutions. i myself have sometimes thought the aging process could be delayed if it had to make its way through congress. [laughter] you will deliberate, and you will discuss, and that is fine. but, my friends, the people cannot wait. they need help now. there's a mood among us. people are worried. there's been talk of decline. someone even said our workers are lazy and uninspired. and i thought: really? you go tell neil armstrong standing on the moon. tell the men and women who put him there. tell the american farmer who feeds his country and the world. tell the men and women of desert storm. moods come and go, but greatness endures. ours does. and maybe for a moment it's good to remember what, in the dailiness of our lives, we forget: we are still and ever the freest nation on earth, the kindest nation on earth, the strongest nation on earth. and we have always risen to the occasion. and we are going to lift this nation out of hard times inch by inch and day by day, and those who would stop us had better step aside. because i look at hard times, and i make this vow: this will not stand. and so, we move on together, a rising nation, the once and future miracle that is still, this night, the hope of the world. thank you. god bless you, and god bless our beloved country. thank you very, very much. \"\n",
      " 'mr. president, mr. speaker, members of the house and the senate, distinguished americans here as visitors in this chamber, as am i. it is nice to have a fresh excuse for giving a long speech. [laughter] when presidents speak to congress and the nation from this podium, typically they comment on the full range in challenges and opportunities that face the united states. but this is not an ordinary time, and for all the many tasks that require our attention, i believe tonight one calls on us to focus, to unite, and to act. and that is our economy. for more than anything else, our task tonight as americans is to make our economy thrive again. let me begin by saying that it has been too long, at least three decades, since a president has come and challenged americans to join him on a great national journey, not merely to consume the bounty of today but to invest for a much greater one tomorrow. like individuals, nations must ultimately decide how they wish to conduct themselves, how they wish to be thought of by those with whom they live, and later, how they wish to be judged by history. like every individual man and woman, nations must decide whether they are prepared to rise to the occasions history presents them. we have always been a people of youthful energy and daring spirit. and at this historic moment, as communism has fallen, as freedom is spreading around the world, as a global economy is taking shape before our eyes, americans have called for change. and now it is up to those of us in this room to deliver for them. our nation needs a new direction. tonight i present to you a comprehensive plan to set our nation on that new course. i believe we will find our new direction in the basic old values that brought us here over the last two centuries: a commitment to opportunity, to individual responsibility, to community, to work, to family, and to faith. we must now break the habits of both political parties and say there can be no more something for nothing and admit frankly that we are all in this together. the conditions which brought us as a nation to this point are well-known: two decades of low productivity, growth, and stagnant wages; persistent unemployment and underemployment; years of huge government deficits and declining investment in our future; exploding health care costs and lack of coverage for millions of americans; legions of poor children; education and job training opportunities inadequate to the demands of this tough, global economy. for too long we have drifted without a strong sense of purpose or responsibility or community. and our political system so often has seemed paralyzed by special interest groups, by partisan bickering, and by the sheer complexity of our problems. i believe we can do better because we remain the greatest nation on earth, the world\\'s strongest economy, the world\\'s only military superpower. if we have the vision, the will, and the heart to make the changes we must, we can still enter the 21st century with possibilities our parents could not even have imagined and enter it having secured the american dream for ourselves and for future generations. i well remember 12 years ago president reagan stood at this very podium and told you and the american people that if our national debt were stacked in thousand-dollar bills, the stack would reach 67 miles into space. well, today that stack would reach 267 miles. i tell you this not to assign blame for this problem. there is plenty of blame to go around in both branches of the government and both parties. the time has come for the blame to end. i did not seek this office to place blame. i come here tonight to accept responsibility, and i want you to accept responsibility with me. and if we do right by this country, i do not care who gets the credit for it. the plan i offer you has four fundamental components. first, it shifts our emphasis in public and private spending from consumption to investment, initially by jumpstarting the economy in the short term and investing in our people, their jobs, and their incomes over the long run. second, it changes the rhetoric of the past into the actions of the present by honoring work and families in every part of our public decision-making. third, it substantially reduces the federal deficit honestly and credibly by using in the beginning the most conservative estimates of government revenues, not, as the executive branch has done so often in the past, using the most optimistic ones. and finally, it seeks to earn the trust of the american people by paying for these plans first with cuts in government waste and efficiency; second, with cuts, not gimmicks, in government spending; and by fairness, for a change, in the way additional burdens are borne. tonight i want to talk with you about what government can do because i believe government must do more. but let me say first that the real engine of economic growth in this country is the private sector, and second, that each of us must be an engine of growth and change. the truth is that as government creates more opportunity in this new and different time, we must also demand more responsibility in turn. our immediate priority must be to create jobs, create jobs now. some people say, \"well, we\\'re in a recovery, and we don\\'t have to do that.\" well, we all hope we\\'re in a recovery, but we\\'re sure not creating new jobs. and there\\'s no recovery worth its salt that doesn\\'t put the american people back to work. to create jobs and guarantee a strong recovery, i call on congress to enact an immediate package of jobs investments of over $30 billion to put people to work now, to create a half a million jobs: jobs to rebuild our highways and airports, to renovate housing, to bring new life to rural communities, and spread hope and opportunity among our nation\\'s youth. especially i want to emphasize, after the events of last year in los angeles and the countless stories of despair in our cities and in our poor rural communities, this proposal will create almost 700,000 new summer jobs for displaced, unemployed young people alone this summer. and tonight i invite america\\'s business leaders to join us in this effort so that together we can provide over one million summer jobs in cities and poor rural areas for our young people. second, our plan looks beyond today\\'s business cycle because our aspirations extend into the next century. the heart of this plan deals with the long term. it is an investment program designed to increase public and private investment in areas critical to our economic future. and it has a deficit reduction program that will increase the savings available for the private sector to invest, will lower interest rates, will decrease the percentage of the federal budget claimed by interest payments, and decrease the risk of financial market disruptions that could adversely affect our economy. over the long run, all this will bring us a higher rate of economic growth, improved productivity, more high-quality jobs, and an improved economic competitive position in the world. in order to accomplish both increased investment and deficit reduction, something no american government has ever been called upon to do at the same time before, spending must be cut and taxes must be raised. the spending cuts i recommend were carefully thought through in a way to minimize any adverse economic impact, to capture the peace dividend for investment purposes, and to switch the balance in the budget from consumption to more investment. the tax increases and the spending cuts were both designed to assure that the cost of this historic program to face and deal with our problems will be borne by those who could readily afford it the most. our plan is designed, furthermore, and perhaps in some ways most importantly, to improve the health of american business through lower interest rates, more incentives to invest, and better trained workers. because small business has created such a high percentage of all the new jobs in our nation over the last 10 or 15 years, our plan includes the boldest targeted incentives for small business in history. we propose a permanent investment tax credit for the smallest firms in this country, with revenues of under $5 million. that\\'s about 90 percent of the firms in america, employing about 40 percent of the work force but creating a big majority of the net new jobs for more than a decade. and we propose new rewards for entrepreneurs who take new risks. we propose to give small business access to all the new technologies of our time. and we propose to attack this credit crunch which has denied small business the credit they need to flourish and prosper. with a new network of community development banks and $1 billion to make the dream of enterprise zones real, we propose to bring new hope and new jobs to storefronts and factories from south boston to south texas to south central los angeles. this plan invests in our roads, our bridges, our transit systems, in high-speed railways and high-tech information systems. and it provides the most ambitious environmental cleanup in partnership with state and local government of our time, to put people to work and to preserve the environment for our future. standing as we are on the edge of a new century, we know that economic growth depends as never before on opening up new markets overseas and expanding the volume of world trade. and so, we will insist on fair trade rules in international markets as a part of a national economic strategy to expand trade, including the successful completion of the latest round of world trade talks and the successful completion of a north american free trade agreement with appropriate safeguards for our workers and for the environment. at the same time—and i say this to you in both parties and across america tonight, all the people who are listening—it is not enough to pass a budget or even to have a trade agreement. this world is changing so fast that we must have aggressive, targeted attempts to create the high-wage jobs of the future. that\\'s what all our competitors are doing. we must give special attention to those critical industries that are going to explode in the 21st century but that are in trouble in america today, like aerospace. we must provide special assistance to areas and to workers displaced by cuts in the defense budget and by other unavoidable economic dislocations. and again i will say we must do this together. i pledge to you that i will do my best to see that business and labor and government work together for a change. but all of our efforts to strengthen the economy will fail—let me say this again; i feel so strongly about this—all of our efforts to strengthen the economy will fail unless we also take this year, not next year, not 5 years from now but this year, bold steps to reform our health care system. in 1992, we spent 14 percent of our income on health care, more than 30 percent more than any other country in the world, and yet we were the only advanced nation that did not provide a basic package of health care benefits to all of its citizens. unless we change the present pattern, 50 percent of the growth in the deficit between now and the year 2000 will be in health care costs. by the year 2000 almost 20 percent of our income will be in health care. our families will never be secure, our businesses will never be strong, and our government will never again be fully solvent until we tackle the health care crisis. we must do it this year. the combination of the rising cost of care and the lack of care and the fear of losing care are endangering the security and the very lives of millions of our people. and they are weakening our economy every day. reducing health care costs can liberate literally hundreds of billions of dollars for new investment in growth and jobs. bringing health costs in line with inflation would do more for the private sector in this country than any tax cut we could give and any spending program we could promote. reforming health care over the long run is critically essential to reducing not only our deficit but to expanding investment in america. later this spring, after the first lady and the many good people who are helping her all across the country complete their work, i will deliver to congress a comprehensive plan for health care reform that finally will bring costs under control and provide security to all of our families, so that no one will be denied the coverage they need but so that our economic future will not be compromised either. we\\'ll have to root out fraud and overcharges and make sure that paperwork no longer chokes your doctor. we\\'ll have to maintain the highest american standards and the right to choose in a system that is the world\\'s finest for all those who can access it. but first we must make choices. we must choose to give the american people the quality they demand and deserve with a system that will not bankrupt the country or further drive more americans into agony. let me further say that i want to work with all of you on this. i realize this is a complicated issue. but we must address it. and i believe if there is any chance that republicans and democrats who disagree on taxes and spending or anything else could agree on one thing, surely we can all look at these numbers and go home and tell our people the truth. we cannot continue these spending patterns in public or private dollars for health care for less and less and less every year. we can do better. and i will work to do better. perhaps the most fundamental change the new direction i propose offers is its focus on the future and its investment which i seek in our children. each day we delay really making a commitment to our children carries a dear cost. half of the 2-year-olds in this country today don\\'t receive the immunizations they need against deadly diseases. our plan will provide them for every eligible child. and we know now that we will save $10 later for every $1 we spend by eliminating preventable childhood diseases. that\\'s a good investment no matter how you measure it. i recommend that the women, infants, and children\\'s nutrition program be expanded so that every expectant mother who needs the help gets it. we all know that head start, a program that prepares children for school, is a success story. we all know that it saves money. but today it just reaches barely over one-third of all the eligible children. under this plan, every eligible child will be able to get a head start. this is not just the right thing to do; it is the smart thing to do. for every dollar we invest today, we\\'ll save $3 tomorrow. we have to start thinking about tomorrow. (i\\'ve heard that somewhere before.) [laughter] we have to ask more in our schools of our students, our teachers, our principals, our parents. yes, we must give them the resources they need to meet high standards, but we must also use the authority and the influence and the funding of the education department to promote strategies that really work in learning. money alone is not enough. we have to do what really works to increase learning in our schools. we have to recognize that all of our high school graduates need some further education in order to be competitive in this global economy. so we have to establish a partnership between businesses and education and the government for apprenticeship programs in every state in this country to give our people the skills they need. lifelong learning must benefit not just young high school graduates but workers, too, throughout their career. the average 18-year-old today will change jobs seven times in a lifetime. we have done a lot in this country on worker training in the last few years, but the system is too fractured. we must develop a unified, simplified, sensible, streamlined worker-training program so that workers receive the training they need regardless of why they lost their jobs or whether they simply need to learn something new to keep them. we have got to do better on this. and finally, i propose a program that got a great response from the american people all across this country last year: a program of national service to make college loans available to all americans and to challenge them at the same time to give something back to their country as teachers or police officers or community service workers; to give them the option to pay the loans back, but at tax time so they can\\'t beat the bill, but to encourage them instead to pay it back by making their country stronger and making their country better and giving us the benefit of their knowledge. a generation ago when president kennedy proposed and the united states congress embraced the peace corps, it defined the character of a whole generation of americans committed to serving people around the world. in this national service program, we will provide more than twice as many slots for people before they go to college to be in national service than ever served in the peace corps. this program could do for this generation of members of congress what the land grant college act did and what the gi bill did for former congressmen. in the future, historians who got their education through the national service loan will look back on you and thank you for giving america a new lease on life, if you meet this challenge. if we believe in jobs and we believe in learning, we must believe in rewarding work. if we believe in restoring the values that make america special, we must believe that there is dignity in all work, and there must be dignity for all workers. to those who care for our sick, who tend our children, who do our most difficult and tiring jobs, the new direction i propose will make this solemn, simple commitment: by expanding the refundable earned-income tax credit, we will make history. we will reward the work of millions of working poor americans by realizing the principle that if you work 40 hours a week and you\\'ve got a child in the house, you will no longer be in poverty. later this year, we will offer a plan to end welfare as we know it. i have worked on this issue for the better part of a decade. and i know from personal conversations with many people that no one, no one wants to change the welfare system as badly as those who are trapped in it. i want to offer the people on welfare the education, the training, the child care, the health care they need to get back on their feet, but say after 2 years they must get back to work, too, in private business if possible, in public service if necessary. we have to end welfare as a way of life and make it a path to independence and dignity. our next great goal should be to strengthen our families. i compliment the congress for passing the family and medical leave act as a good first step, but it is time to do more. this plan will give this country the toughest child support enforcement system it has ever had. it is time to demand that people take responsibility for the children they bring in this world. and i ask you to help to protect our families against the violent crime which terrorizes our people and which tears our communities apart. we must pass a tough crime bill. i support not only the bill which didn\\'t quite make it to the president\\'s desk last year but also an initiative to put 100,000 more police officers on the street, to provide boot camps for first-time nonviolent offenders for more space for the hardened criminals in jail. and i support an initiative to do what we can to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. let me say this. i will make you this bargain: if you will pass the brady bill, i\\'ll sure sign it. let me say now, we should move to the harder parts. i think it is clear to every american, including every member of congress of both parties, that the confidence of the people who pay our bills in our institutions in washington is not high. we must restore it. we must begin again to make government work for ordinary taxpayers, not simply for organized interest groups. and that beginning must start with real political reform. i am asking the united states congress to pass a real campaign finance reform bill this year. i ask you to increase the participation of the american people by passing the motor voter bill promptly. i ask you to deal with the undue influence of special interests by passing a bill to end the tax deduction for lobbying and to act quickly to require all the people who lobby you to register as lobbyists by passing the lobbying registration bill. believe me, they were cheering that last section at home. i believe lobby reform and campaign finance reform are a sure path to increased popularity for republicans and democrats alike because it says to the voters back home, \"this is your house. this is your senate. we\\'re your hired hands, and every penny we draw is your money.\" next, to revolutionize government we have to ensure that we live within our means, and that should start at the top and with the white house. in the last few days i have announced a cut in the white house staff of 25 percent, saving approximately $10 million. i have ordered administrative cuts in budgets of agencies and departments. i have cut the federal bureaucracy, or will over the next 4 years, by approximately 100,000 positions, for a combined savings of $9 billion. it is time for government to demonstrate, in the condition we\\'re in, that we can be as frugal as any household in america. and that\\'s why i also want to congratulate the congress. i noticed the announcement of the leadership today that congress is taking similar steps to cut its costs. i think that is important. i think it will send a very clear signal to the american people. but if we really want to cut spending, we\\'re going to have to do more, and some of it will be difficult. tonight i call for an across-the-board freeze in federal government salaries for one year. and thereafter, during this 4-year period, i recommend that salaries rise at one point lower than the cost of living allowance normally involved in federal pay increases. next, i recommend that we make 150 specific budget cuts, as you know, and that all those who say we should cut more be as specific as i have been.finally, let me say to my friends on both sides of the aisle, it is not enough simply to cut government; we have to rethink the whole way it works. when i became president i was amazed at just the way the white house worked, in ways that added lots of money to what taxpayers had to pay, outmoded ways that didn\\'t take maximum advantage of technology and didn\\'t do things that any business would have done years ago to save taxpayers\\' money. so i want to bring a new spirit of innovation into every government department. i want to push education reform, as i said, not just to spend more money but to really improve learning. some things work, and some things don\\'t. we ought to be subsidizing the things that work and discouraging the things that don\\'t. i\\'d like to use that superfund to clean up pollution for a change and not just pay lawyers. in the aftermath of all the difficulties with the savings and loans, we must use federal bank regulators to protect the security and safety of our financial institutions, but they should not be used to continue the credit crunch and to stop people from making sensible loans. i\\'d like for us to not only have welfare reform but to reexamine the whole focus of all of our programs that help people, to shift them from entitlement programs to empowerment programs. in the end we want people not to need us anymore. i think that\\'s important. but in the end we have to get back to the deficit. for years there\\'s been a lot of talk about it but very few credible efforts to deal with it. and now i understand why, having dealt with the real numbers for 4 weeks. but i believe this plan does; it tackles the budget deficit seriously and over the long term. it puts in place one of the biggest deficit reductions and one of the biggest changes in federal priorities, from consumption to investment, in the history of this country at the same time over the next 4 years. let me say to all the people watching us tonight who will ask me these questions beginning tomorrow as i go around the country and who\\'ve asked it in the past: we\\'re not cutting the deficit just because experts say it\\'s the thing to do or because it has some intrinsic merit. we have to cut the deficit because the more we spend paying off the debt, the less tax dollars we have to invest in jobs and education and the future of this country. and the more money we take out of the pool of available savings, the harder it is for people in the private sector to borrow money at affordable interest rates for a college loan for their children, for a home mortgage, or to start a new business. that\\'s why we\\'ve got to reduce the debt, because it is crowding out other activities that we ought to be engaged in and that the american people ought to be engaged in. we cut the deficit so that our children will be able to buy a home, so that our companies can invest in the future and in retraining their workers, so that our government can make the kinds of investments we need to be a stronger and smarter and safer nation. if we don\\'t act now, you and i might not even recognize this government 10 years from now. if we just stay with the same trends of the last 4 years, by the end of the decade the deficit will be $635 billion a year, almost 80 percent of our gross domestic product. and paying interest on that debt will be the costliest government program of all. we\\'ll still be the world\\'s largest debtor. and when members of congress come here, they\\'ll be devoting over 20 cents on the dollar to interest payments, more than half of the budget to health care and to other entitlements. and you\\'ll come here and deliberate and argue over 6 or 7 cents on the dollar, no matter what america\\'s problems are. we will not be able to have the independence we need to chart the future that we must. and we\\'ll be terribly dependent on foreign funds for a large portion of our investment. this budget plan, by contrast, will by 1997 cut $140 billion in that year alone from the deficit, a real spending cut, a real revenue increase, a real deficit reduction, using the independent numbers of the congressional budget office. [laughter] well, you can laugh, my fellow republicans, but i\\'ll point out that the congressional budget office was normally more conservative in what was going to happen and closer to right than previous presidents have been. i did this so that we could argue about priorities with the same set of numbers. i did this so that no one could say i was estimating my way out of this difficulty. i did this because if we can agree together on the most prudent revenues we\\'re likely to get if the recovery stays and we do right things economically, then it will turn out better for the american people than we say. in the last 12 years, because there were differences over the revenue estimates, you and i know that both parties were given greater elbow room for irresponsibility. this is tightening the rein on the democrats as well as the republicans. let\\'s at least argue about the same set of numbers so the american people will think we\\'re shooting straight with them. as i said earlier, my recommendation makes more than 150 difficult reductions to cut the federal spending by a total of $246 billion. we are eliminating programs that are no longer needed, such as nuclear power research and development. we\\'re slashing subsidies and canceling wasteful projects. but many of these programs were justified in their time, and a lot of them are difficult for me to recommend reductions in, some really tough ones for me personally. i recommend that we reduce interest subsidies to the rural electric administration. that\\'s a difficult thing for me to recommend. but i think that i cannot exempt the things that exist in my state or in my experience, if i ask you to deal with things that are difficult for you to deal with. we\\'re going to have to have no sacred cows except the fundamental abiding interest of the american people. i have to say that we all know our government has been just great at building programs. the time has come to show the american people that we can limit them too; that we can not only start things, that we can actually stop things. about the defense budget, i raise a hope and a caution. as we restructure our military forces to meet the new threats of the post-cold-war world, it is true that we can responsibly reduce our defense budget. and we may all doubt what that range of reductions is, but let me say that as long as i am president, i will do everything i can to make sure that the men and women who serve under the american flag will remain the best trained, the best prepared, the best equipped fighting force in the world. and every one of you should make that solemn pledge. we still have responsibilities around the world. we are the world\\'s only superpower. this is still a dangerous and uncertain time, and we owe it to the people in uniform to make sure that we adequately provide for the national defense and for their interests and needs. backed by an effective national defense and a stronger economy, our nation will be prepared to lead a world challenged as it is everywhere by ethnic conflict, by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, by the global democratic revolution, and by challenges to the health of our global environment. i know this economic plan is ambitious, but i honestly believe it is necessary for the continued greatness of the united states. and i think it is paid for fairly, first by cutting government, then by asking the most of those who benefited the most in the past, and by asking more americans to contribute today so that all of us can prosper tomorrow. for the wealthiest, those earning more than $180,000 per year, i ask you all who are listening tonight to support a raise in the top rate for federal income taxes from 31 to 36 percent. we recommend a 10 percent surtax on incomes over $250,000 a year, and we recommend closing some loopholes that let some people get away without paying any tax at all. for businesses with taxable incomes in excess of $10 million, we recommend a raise in the corporate tax rate, also to 36 percent, as well as a cut in the deduction for business entertainment expenses. our plan seeks to attack tax subsidies that actually reward companies more for shutting their operations down here and moving them overseas than for staying here and reinvesting in america. i say that as someone who believes that american companies should be free to invest around the world and as a former governor who actively sought investment of foreign companies in my state. but the tax code should not express a preference to american companies for moving somewhere else, and it does in particular cases today. we will seek to ensure that, through effective tax enforcement, foreign corporations who do make money in america simply pay the same taxes that american companies make on the same income. to middle class americans who have paid a great deal for the last 12 years and from whom i ask a contribution tonight, i will say again as i did on monday night: you\\'re not going alone any more, you\\'re certainly not going first, and you\\'re not going to pay more for less as you have too often in the past. i want to emphasize the facts about this plan: 98.8 percent of america\\'s families will have no increase in their income tax rates, only 1.2 percent at the top. let me be clear: there will also be no new cuts in benefits for medicare. as we move toward the 4th year, with the explosion in health care costs, as i said, projected to account for 50 percent of the growth of the deficit between now and the year 2000, there must be planned cuts in payments to providers, to doctors, to hospitals, to labs, as a way of controlling health care costs. but i see these only as a stopgap until we can reform the entire health care system. if you\\'ll help me do that, we can be fair to the providers and to the consumers of health care. let me repeat this, because i know it matters to a lot of you on both sides of the aisle. this plan does not make a recommendation for new cuts in medicare benefits for any beneficiary. secondly, the only change we are making in social security is one that has already been publicized. the plan does ask older americans with higher incomes, who do not rely solely on social security to get by, to contribute more. this plan will not affect the 80 percent of social security recipients who do not pay taxes on social security now. those who do not pay tax on social security now will not be affected by this plan. our plan does include a broad-based tax on energy, and i want to tell you why i selected this and why i think it\\'s a good idea. i recommend that we adopt a btu tax on the heat content of energy as the best way to provide us with revenue to lower the deficit because it also combats pollution, promotes energy efficiency, promotes the independence, economically, of this country as well as helping to reduce the debt, and because it does not discriminate against any area. unlike a carbon tax, that\\'s not too hard on the coal states; unlike a gas tax, that\\'s not too tough on people who drive a long way to work; unlike an ad valorem tax, it doesn\\'t increase just when the price of an energy source goes up. and it is environmentally responsible. it will help us in the future as well as in the present with the deficit. taken together, these measures will cost an american family with an income of about $40,000 a year less than $17 a month. it will cost american families with incomes under $30,000 nothing because of other programs we propose, principally those raising the earned-income tax credit. because of our publicly stated determination to reduce the deficit, if we do these things, we will see the continuation of what\\'s happened just since the election. just since the election, since the secretary of the treasury, the director of the office of management and budget, and others who have begun to speak out publicly in favor of a tough deficit reduction plan, interest rates have continued to fall long-term. that means that for the middle class who will pay something more each month, if they had any credit needs or demands, their increased energy costs will be more than offset by lower interest costs for mortgages, consumer loans, credit cards. this can be a wise investment for them and their country now. i would also point out what the american people already know, and that is, because we\\'re a big, vast country where we drive long distances, we have maintained far lower burdens on energy than any other advanced country. we will still have far lower burdens on energy than any other advanced country. and these will be spread fairly, with real attempts to make sure that no cost is imposed on families with incomes under $30,000 and that the costs are very modest until you get into the higher income groups where the income taxes trigger in. now, i ask all of you to consider this: whatever you think of the tax program, whatever you think of the spending cuts, consider the cost of not changing. remember the numbers that you all know. if we just keep on doing what we\\'re doing, by the end of the decade we\\'ll have a $650-billion-a-year deficit. if we just keep on doing what we\\'re doing, by the end of the decade 20 percent of our national income will go to health care every year, twice as much as any other country on the face of the globe. if we just keep on doing what we\\'re doing, over 20 cents on the dollar will have to go to service the debt. unless we have the courage now to start building our future and stop borrowing from it, we\\'re condemning ourselves to years of stagnation interrupted by occasional recessions, to slow growth in jobs, to no more growth in income, to more debt, to more disappointment. worse, unless we change, unless we increase investment and reduce the debt to raise productivity so that we can generate both jobs and incomes, we will be condemning our children and our children\\'s children to a lesser life than we enjoyed. once americans looked forward to doubling their living standards every 25 years. at present productivity rates, it will take 100 years to double living standards, until our grandchildren\\'s grandchildren are born. i say that is too long to wait. tonight the american people know we have to change. but they\\'re also likely to ask me tomorrow and all of you for the weeks and months ahead whether we have the fortitude to make the changes happen in the right way. they know that as soon as i leave this chamber and you go home, various interest groups will be out in force lobbying against this or that piece of this plan, and that the forces of conventional wisdom will offer a thousand reasons why we well ought to do this but we just can\\'t do it. our people will be watching and wondering, not to see whether you disagree with me on a particular issue but just to see whether this is going to be business as usual or a real new day, whether we\\'re all going to conduct ourselves as if we know we\\'re working for them. we must scale the walls of the people\\'s scepticisms, not with our words but with our deeds. after so many years of gridlock and indecision, after so many hopeful beginnings and so few promising results, the american people are going to be harsh in their judgments of all of us if we fail to seize this moment. this economic plan can\\'t please everybody. if the package is picked apart, there will be something that will anger each of us, won\\'t please anybody. but if it is taken as a whole, it will help all of us. so i ask you all to begin by resisting the temptation to focus only on a particular spending cut you don\\'t like or some particular investment that wasn\\'t made. and nobody likes the tax increases, but let\\'s just face facts. for 20 years, through administrations of both parties, incomes have stalled and debt has exploded and productivity has not grown as it should. we cannot deny the reality of our condition. we have got to play the hand we were dealt and play it as best we can. my fellow americans, the test of this plan cannot be \"what is in it for me.\" it has got to be \"what is in it for us.\" if we work hard and if we work together, if we rededicate ourselves to creating jobs, to rewarding work, to strengthening our families, to reinventing our government, we can lift our country\\'s fortunes again. tonight i ask everyone in this chamber and every american to look simply into your heart, to spark your own hopes, to fire your own imagination. there is so much good, so much possibility, so much excitement in this country now that if we act boldly and honestly, as leaders should, our legacy will be one of prosperity and progress. this must be america\\'s new direction. let us summon the courage to seize it.thank you. god bless america.'\n",
      " 'thank you very much. mr. speaker, mr. president, members of the 103d congress, my fellow americans: i\\'m not at all sure what speech is in the teleprompter tonight—[laughter]—but i hope we can talk about the state of the union. i ask you to begin by recalling the memory of the giant who presided over this chamber with such force and grace. tip o\\'neill liked to call himself \"a man of the house.\" and he surely was that. but even more, he was a man of the people, a bricklayer\\'s son who helped to build the great american middle class. tip o\\'neill never forgot who he was, where he came from, or who sent him here. tonight he\\'s smiling down on us for the first time from the lord\\'s gallery. but in his honor, may we, too, always remember who we are, where we come from, and who sent us here. if we do that we will return over and over again to the principle that if we simply give ordinary people equal opportunity, quality education, and a fair shot at the american dream, they will do extraordinary things. we gather tonight in a world of changes so profound and rapid that all nations are tested. our american heritage has always been to master such change, to use it to expand opportunity at home and our leadership abroad. but for too long and in too many ways, that heritage was abandoned, and our country drifted. for 30 years, family life in america has been breaking down. for 20 years, the wages of working people have been stagnant or declining. for the 12 years of trickle-down economics, we built a false prosperity on a hollow base as our national debt quadrupled. from 1989 to 1992, we experienced the slowest growth in a half century. for too many families, even when both parents were working, the american dream has been slipping away. in 1992, the american people demanded that we change. a year ago i asked all of you to join me in accepting responsibility for the future of our country. well, we did. we replaced drift and deadlock with renewal and reform. and i want to thank every one of you here who heard the american people, who broke gridlock, who gave them the most successful teamwork between a president and a congress in 30 years. this congress produced a budget that cut the deficit by half a trillion dollars, cut spending, and raised income taxes on only the wealthiest americans. this congress produced tax relief for millions of low-income workers to reward work over welfare. it produced nafta. it produced the brady bill, now the brady law. and thank you, jim brady, for being here, and god bless you, sir. this congress produced tax cuts to reduce the taxes of 9 out of 10 small businesses who use the money to invest more and create more jobs. it produced more research and treatment for aids, more childhood immunizations, more support for women\\'s health research, more affordable college loans for the middle class, a new national service program for those who want to give something back to their country and their communities for higher education, a dramatic increase in high-tech investments to move us from a defense to a domestic high-tech economy. this congress produced a new law, the motor voter bill, to help millions of people register to vote. it produced family and medical leave. all passed. all signed into law with not one single veto. these accomplishments were all commitments i made when i sought this office. and in fairness, they all had to be passed by you in this congress. but i am persuaded that the real credit belongs to the people who sent us here, who pay our salaries, who hold our feet to the fre. but what we do here is really beginning to change lives. let me just give you one example. i will never forget what the family and medical leave law meant to just one father i met early one sunday morning in the white house. it was unusual to see a family there touring early sunday morning, but he had his wife and his three children there, one of them in a wheelchair. i came up, and after we had our picture taken and had a little visit, i was walking off and that man grabbed me by the arm and he said, \"mr. president, let me tell you something. my little girl here is desperately ill. she\\'s probably not going to make it. but because of the family leave law, i was able to take time off to spend with her, the most important time i ever spent in my life, without losing my job and hurting the rest of my family. it means more to me than i will ever be able to say. don\\'t you people up here ever think what you do doesn\\'t make a difference. it does.\" though we are making a difference, our work has just begun. many americans still haven\\'t felt the impact of what we\\'ve done. the recovery still hasn\\'t touched every community or created enough jobs. incomes are still stagnant. there\\'s still too much violence and not enough hope in too many places. abroad, the young democracies we are strongly supporting still face very difficult times and look to us for leadership. and so tonight, let us resolve to continue the journey of renewal, to create more and better jobs, to guarantee health security for all, to reward work over welfare, to promote democracy abroad, and to begin to reclaim our streets from violent crime and drugs and gangs, to renew our own american community. last year we began to put our house in order by tackling the budget deficit that was driving us toward bankruptcy. we cut $255 billion in spending, including entitlements, and over 340 separate budget items. we froze domestic spending and used honest budget numbers. led by the vice president, we launched a campaign to reinvent government. we cut staff, cut perks, even trimmed the fleet of federal limousines. after years of leaders whose rhetoric attacked bureaucracy but whose action expanded it, we will actually reduce it by 252,000 people over the next 5 years. by the time we have finished, the federal bureaucracy will be at its lowest point in 30 years. because the deficit was so large and because they benefited from tax cuts in the 1980\\'s, we did ask the wealthiest americans to pay more to reduce the deficit. so on april the 15th, the american people will discover the truth about what we did last year on taxes. only the top 1—[applause]—yes, listen, the top 1.2 percent of americans, as i said all along, will pay higher income tax rates. let me repeat: only the wealthiest 1.2 percent of americans will face higher income tax rates, and no one else will. and that is the truth. of course, there were, as there always are in politics, naysayers who said this plan wouldn\\'t work. but they were wrong. when i became president, the experts predicted that next year\\'s deficit would be $300 billion. but because we acted, those same people now say the deficit is going to be under $180 billion, 40 percent lower than was previously predicted. our economic program has helped to produce the lowest core inflation rate and the lowest interest rates in 20 years. and because those interest rates are down, business investment and equipment is growing at 7 times the rate of the previous 4 years. auto sales are way up. home sales are at a record high. millions of americans have refinanced their homes, and our economy has produced 1.6 million private sector jobs in 1993, more than were created in the previous 4 years combined. the people who supported this economic plan should be proud of its early results. proud. but everyone in this chamber should know and acknowledge that there is more to do. next month i will send you one of the toughest budgets ever presented to congress. it will cut spending in more than 300 programs,  eliminate 100 domestic programs, and reform the ways in which governments buy goods and services. this year we must again make the hard choices to live within the hard spending ceilings we have set. we must do it. we have proved we can bring the deficit down without choking off recovery, without punishing seniors or the middle class, and without putting our national security at risk. if you will stick with this plan, we will post 3 consecutive years of declining deficits for the first time since harry truman lived in the white house. and once again, the buck stops here. our economic plan also bolsters our strength and our credibility around the world. once we reduced the deficit and put the steel back into our competitive edge, the world echoed with the sound of falling trade barriers. in one year, with nafta, with gatt, with our efforts in asia and the national export strategy, we did more to open world markets to american products than at any time in the last two generations. that means more jobs and rising living standards for the american people, low deficits, low inflation, low interest rates, low trade barriers, and high investments. these are the building blocks of our recovery. but if we want to take full advantage of the opportunities before us in the global economy, you all know we must do more. as we reduce defense spending, i ask congress to invest more in the technologies of tomorrow. defense conversion will keep us strong militarily and create jobs for our people here at home. as we protect our environment, we must invest in the environmental technologies of the future which will create jobs. this year we will fight for a revitalized clean water act and a safe drinking water act and a reformed superfund program. and the vice president is right, we must also work with the private sector to connect every classroom, every clinic, every library, every hospital in america into a national information super highway by the year 2000. think of it, instant access to information will increase productivity, will help to educate our children. it will provide better medical care. it will create jobs. and i call on the congress to pass legislation to establish that information super highway this year. as we expand opportunity and create jobs, no one can be left out. we must continue to enforce fair lending and fair housing and all civil rights laws, because america will never be complete in its renewal until everyone shares in its bounty. but we all know, too, we can do all these things, put our economic house in order, expand world trade, target the jobs of the future, guarantee equal opportunity, but if we\\'re honest, we\\'ll all admit that this strategy still cannot work unless we also give our people the education, training, and skills they need to seize the opportunities of tomorrow. we must set tough, world-class academic and occupational standards for all our children and give our teachers and students the tools they need to meet them. our goals 2000 proposal will empower individual school districts to experiment with ideas like chartering their schools to be run by private corporations or having more public school choice, to do whatever they wish to do as long as we measure every school by one high standard: are our children learning what they need to know to compete and win in the global economy? goals 2000 links world-class standards to grassroots reforms. and i hope congress will pass it without delay. our school to work initiative will for the first time link school to the world of work, providing at least one year of apprenticeship beyond high school. after all, most of the people we\\'re counting on to build our economic future won\\'t graduate from college. it\\'s time to stop ignoring them and start empowering them. we must literally transform our outdated unemployment system into a new reemployment system. the old unemployment system just sort of kept you going while you waited for your old job to come back. we\\'ve got to have a new system to move people into new and better jobs, because most of those old jobs just don\\'t come back. and we know that the only way to have real job security in the future, to get a good job with a growing income, is to have real skills and the ability to learn new ones. so we\\'ve got to streamline today\\'s patchwork of training programs and make them a source of new skills for our people who lose their jobs. reemployment, not unemployment, must become the centerpiece of our economic renewal. i urge you to pass it in this session of congress. and just as we must transform our unemployment system, so must we also revolutionize our welfare system. it doesn\\'t work. it defies our values as a nation. if we value work, we can\\'t justify a system that makes welfare more attractive than work if people are worried about losing their health care. if we value responsibility, we can\\'t ignore the $34 billion in child support absent parents ought to be paying to millions of parents who are taking care of their children. if we value strong families, we can\\'t perpetuate a system that actually penalizes those who stay together. can you believe that a child who has a child gets more money from the government for leaving home than for staying home with a parent or a grandparent? that\\'s not just bad policy, it\\'s wrong. and we ought to change it. i worked on this problem for years before i became president, with other governors and with members of congress of both parties and with the previous administration of another party. i worked on it with people who were on welfare, lots of them. and i want to say something to everybody here who cares about this issue. the people who most want to change this system are the people who are dependent on it. they want to get off welfare. they want to go back to work. they want to do right by their kids. i once had a hearing when i was a governor, and i brought in people on welfare from all over america who had found their way to work. the woman from my state who testified was asked this question: what\\'s the best thing about being off welfare and in a job? and without blinking an eye, she looked at 40 governors, and she said, \"when my boy goes to school and they say what does you mother do for a living, he can give an answer.\" these people want a better system, and we ought to give it to them. last year we began this. we gave the states more power to innovate because we know that a lot of great ideas come from outside washington, and many states are already using it. then this congress took a dramatic step. instead of taxing people with modest incomes into poverty, we helped them to work their way out of poverty by dramatically increasing the earned-income tax credit. it will lift 15 million working families out of poverty, rewarding work over welfare, making it possible for people to be successful workers and successful parents. now that\\'s real welfare reform. but there is more to be done. this spring i will send you a comprehensive welfare reform bill that  builds on the family support act of 1988 and restores the basic values of work and responsibility. we\\'ll say to teenagers, \"if you have a child out of wedlock, we will no longer give you a check to set up a separate household. we want families to stay together;\" say to absent parents who aren\\'t paying their child support, \"if you\\'re not providing for your children, we\\'ll garnish your wages, suspend your license, track you across state lines, and if necessary, make some of you work off what you owe.\" people who bring children into this world cannot and must not walk away from them. but to all those who depend on welfare, we should offer ultimately a simple compact. we\\'ll provide the support, the job training, the child care you need for up to 2 years. but after that, anyone who can work, must, in the private sector wherever possible, in community service, if necessary. that\\'s the only way we\\'ll ever make welfare what it ought to be, a second chance, not a way of life. i know it will be difficult to tackle welfare reform in 1994 at the same time we tackle health care. but let me point out, i think it is inevitable and imperative. it is estimated that one million people are on welfare today because it\\'s the only way they can get health care coverage for their children. those who choose to leave welfare for jobs without health benefits, and many entry-level jobs don\\'t have health benefits, find themselves in the incredible position of paying taxes that help to pay for health care coverage for those who made the other choice to stay on welfare. no wonder  people leave work and go back to welfare to get health care coverage. we\\'ve got to solve the health care problem to have real welfare reform. so this year, we will make history by reforming the health care system. and i would say to you, all of you, my fellow public servants, this is another issue where the people are way ahead of the politicians. that may not be popular with either party, but it happens to be the truth. you know, the first lady has received now almost a million letters from people all across america and from all walks of life. i\\'d like to share just one of them with you. richard anderson of reno, nevada, lost his job and with it, his health insurance. two weeks later his wife, judy, suffered a cerebral aneurysm. he rushed her to the hospital, where she stayed in intensive care for 21 days. the andersons\\' bills were over $120,000. although judy recovered and richard went back to work at $8 an hour, the bills were too much for them, and they were literally forced into bankruptcy. \"mrs. clinton,\" he wrote to hillary, \"no one in the united states of america should have to lose everything they\\'ve worked for all their lives because they were unfortunate enough to become ill.\" it was to help the richard and judy andersons of america that the first lady and so many others have worked so hard and so long on this health care reform issue. we owe them our thanks and our action. i know there are people here who say there\\'s no health care crisis. tell it to richard and judy anderson. tell it to the 58 million americans who have no coverage at all for some time each year. tell it to the 81 million americans with those preexisting conditions. those folks are paying more, or they can\\'t get insurance at all. or they can\\'t ever change their jobs because they or someone in their family has one of those preexisting conditions. tell it to the small businesses burdened by the skyrocketing cost of insurance. most small businesses cover their employees, and they pay on average 35 percent more in premiums than big businesses or government. or tell it to the 76 percent of insured americans, three out of four whose policies have lifetime limits. and that means they can find themselves without any coverage at all just when they need it the most. so if any of you believe there\\'s no crisis, you tell it to those people, because i can\\'t. there are some people who literally do not understand the impact of this problem on people\\'s lives. and all you have to do is go out and listen to them. just go talk to them anywhere in any congressional district in this country. they\\'re republicans and democrats and independents; it doesn\\'t have a lick to do with party. they think we don\\'t get it. and it\\'s time we show them that we do get it. from the day we began, our health care initiative has been designed to strengthen what is good about our health care system: the world\\'s best health care professionals, cutting-edge research and wonderful research institutions, medicare for older americans. none of this, none of it should be put at risk. but we\\'re paying more and more money for less and less care. every year fewer and fewer americans even get to choose their doctors. every year doctors and nurses spend more time on paperwork and less time with patients because of the absolute bureaucratic nightmare the present system has become. this system is riddled with inefficiency, with abuse, with fraud, and everybody knows it. in today\\'s health care system, insurance companies call the shots. they pick whom they cover and how they cover them. they can cut off your benefits when you need your coverage the most. they are in charge. what does it mean? it means every night millions of well-insured americans go to bed just an illness, an accident, or a pink slip away from having no coverage or financial ruin. it means every morning millions of americans go to work without any health insurance at all, something the workers in no other advanced country in the world do. it means that every year, more and more hard-working people are told to pick a new doctor because their boss has had to pick a new plan. and countless others turn down better jobs because they know if they take the better job, they will lose their health insurance. if we just let the health care system continue to drift, our country will have people with less care, fewer choices, and higher bills. now, our approach protects the quality of care and people\\'s choices. it builds on what works today in the private sector, to expand employer-based coverage, to guarantee private insurance for every american. and i might say, employer-based private insurance for every american was proposed 20 years ago by president richard nixon to the united states congress. it was a good idea then, and it\\'s a better idea today. why do we want guaranteed private insurance? because right now 9 out of 10 people who have insurance get it through their employers. and that should continue. and if your employer is providing good benefits at reasonable prices, that should continue, too. that ought to make the congress and the president feel better. our goal is health insurance everybody can depend on: comprehensive benefits that cover preventive care and prescription drugs; health premiums that don\\'t just explode when you get sick or you get older; the power, no matter how small your business is, to choose dependable insurance at the same competitive rates governments and big business get today; one simple form for people who are sick; and most of all, the freedom to choose a plan and the right to choose your own doctor. our approach protects older americans. every plan before the congress proposes to slow the growth of medicare. the difference is this: we believe those savings should be used to improve health care for senior citizens. medicare must be protected, and it should cover prescription drugs, and we should take the first steps in covering long-term care. to those who would cut medicare without protecting seniors, i say the solution to today\\'s squeeze on middle-class working people\\'s health care is not to put the squeeze on middle-class retired people\\'s health care. we can do better than that. when it\\'s all said and done, it\\'s pretty simple to me. insurance ought to mean what it used to mean: you pay a fair price for security, and when you get sick, health care\\'s always there, no matter what. along with the guarantee of health security, we all have to admit, too, there must be more responsibility on the part of all of us in how we use this system. people have to take their kids to get immunized. we should all take advantage of preventive care. we must all work together to stop the violence that explodes our emergency rooms. we have to practice better health habits, and we can\\'t abuse the system. and those who don\\'t have insurance under our approach will get coverage, but they\\'ll have to pay something for it, too. the minority of businesses that provide no insurance at all and in so doing shift the cost of the care of their employees to others, should contribute something. people who smoke should pay more for a pack of cigarettes. everybody can contribute something if we want to solve the health care crisis. there can\\'t be any more something for nothing. it will not be easy but it can be done. now, in the coming months i hope very much to work with both democrats and republicans to reform a health care system by using the market to bring down costs and to achieve lasting health security. but if you look at history we see that for 60 years this country has tried to reform health care. president roosevelt tried. president truman tried. president nixon tried. president carter tried. every time the special interests were powerful enough to defeat them. but not this time. i know that facing up to these interests will require courage. it will raise critical questions about the way we finance our campaigns and how lobbyists yield their influence. the work of change, frankly, will never get any easier until we limit the influence of well-financed interests who profit from this current system. so i also must now call on you to finish the job both houses began last year by passing tough and meaningful campaign finance reform and lobby reform legislation this year. you know, my fellow americans, this is really a test for all of us. the american people provide those of us in government service with terrific health care benefits at reasonable costs. we have health care that\\'s always there. i think we need to give every hard-working, tax-paying american the same health care security they have already given to us. i want to make this very clear. i am open, as i have said repeatedly, to the best ideas of concerned members of both parties. i have no special brief for any specific approach, even in our own bill, except this: if you send me legislation that does not guarantee every american private health insurance that can never be taken away, you will force me to take this pen, veto the legislation, and we\\'ll come right back here and start all over again. but i don\\'t think that\\'s going to happen. i think we\\'re ready to act now. i believe that you\\'re ready to act now. and if you\\'re ready to guarantee every american the same health care that you have, health care that can never be taken away, now, not next year or the year after, now is the time to stand with the people who sent us here. now. as we take these steps together to renew our strength at home, we cannot turn away from our obligation to renew our leadership abroad. this is a promising moment. because of the agreements we have reached this year, last year, russia\\'s strategic nuclear missiles soon will no longer be pointed at the united states, nor will we point ours at them. instead of building weapons in space, russian scientists will help us to build the international space station. of course, there are still dangers in the world: rampant arms proliferation, bitter regional conflicts, ethnic and nationalist tensions in many new democracies, severe environmental degradation the world over, and fanatics who seek to cripple the world\\'s cities with terror. as the world\\'s greatest power, we must, therefore, maintain our defenses and our responsibilities. this year, we secured indictments against terrorists and sanctions against those who harbor them. we worked to promote environmentally sustainable economic growth. we achieved agreements with ukraine, with belarus, with kazakhstan to eliminate completely their nuclear arsenal. we are working to achieve a korean peninsula free of nuclear weapons. we will seek early ratification of a treaty to ban chemical weapons worldwide. and earlier today, we joined with over 30 nations to begin negotiations on a comprehensive ban to stop all nuclear testing. but nothing, nothing is more important to our security than our nation\\'s armed forces. we honor their contributions, including those who are carrying out the longest humanitarian air lift in history in bosnia, those who will complete their mission in somalia this year and their brave comrades who gave their lives there. our forces are the finest military our nation has ever had. and i have pledged that as long as i am president, they will remain the best equipped, the best trained, and the best prepared fighting force on the face of the earth. last year i proposed a defense plan that maintains our post-cold-war security at a lower cost. this year many people urged me to cut our defense spending further to pay for other government programs. i said, no. the budget i send to congress draws the line against further defense cuts. it protects the readiness and quality of our forces. ultimately, the best strategy is to do that. we must not cut defense further. i hope the congress, without regard to party, will support that position. ultimately, the best strategy to ensure our security and to build a durable peace is to support the advance of democracy elsewhere. democracies don\\'t attack each other, they make better trading partners and partners in diplomacy. that is why we have supported, you and i, the democratic reformers in russia and in the other states of the former soviet bloc. i applaud the bipartisan support this congress provided last year for our initiatives to help russia, ukraine, and the other states through their epic transformations. our support of reform must combine patience for the enormity of the task and vigilance for our fundamental interest and values. we will continue to urge russia and the other states to press ahead with economic reforms. and we will seek to cooperate with russia to solve regional problems, while insisting that if russian troops operate in neighboring states, they do so only when those states agree to their presence and in strict accord with international standards. but we must also remember as these nations chart their own futures—and they must chart their own futures—how much more secure and more prosperous our own people will be if democratic and market reforms succeed all across the former communist bloc. our policy has been to support that move, and that has been the policy of the congress. we should continue it. that is why i went to europe earlier this month, to work with our european partners, to help to integrate all the former communist countries into a europe that has a possibility of becoming unified for the first time in its entire history, its entire history, based on the simple commitments of all nations in europe to democracy, to free markets, and to respect for existing borders. with our allies we have created a partnership for peace that invites states from the former soviet bloc and other non-nato members to work with nato in military cooperation. when i met with central europe\\'s leaders, including lech walesa and vбclav havel, men who put their lives on the line for freedom, i told them that the security of their region is important to our country\\'s security. this year we must also do more to support democratic renewal and human rights and sustainable development all around the world. we will ask congress to ratify the new gatt accord. we will continue standing by south africa as it works its way through its bold and hopeful and difficult transition to democracy. we will convene a summit of the western hemisphere\\'s democratic leaders from canada to the tip of south america. and we will continue to press for the restoration of true democracy in haiti. and as we build a more constructive relationship with china, we must continue to insist on clear signs of improvement in that nation\\'s human rights record. we will also work for new progress toward the middle east peace. last year the world watched yitzhak rabin and yasser arafat at the white house when they had their historic handshake of reconciliation. but there is a long, hard road ahead. and on that road i am determined that i and our administration will do all we can to achieve a comprehensive and lasting peace for all the peoples of the region. now, there are some in our country who argue that with the cold war, america should turn its back on the rest of the world. many around the world were afraid we would do just that. but i took this office on a pledge that had no partisan tinge, to keep our nation secure by remaining engaged in the rest of the world. and this year, because of our work together, enacting nafta, keeping our military strong and prepared, supporting democracy abroad, we have reaffirmed america\\'s leadership, america\\'s engagement. and as a result, the american people are more secure than they were before. but while americans are more secure from threats abroad, i think we all know that in many ways we are less secure from threats here at home. every day the national peace is shattered by crime. in petaluma, california, an innocent slumber party gives way to agonizing tragedy for the family of polly klaas.  an ordinary train  ride on long island ends in a hail of 9-millimeter rounds. a tourist in florida is nearly burned alive by bigots simply because he is black. right here in our nation\\'s capital, a brave young man named jason white, a policeman, the son and grandson of policemen, is ruthlessly gunned down. violent crime and the fear it provokes are crippling our society, limiting personal freedom, and fraying the ties that bind us. the crime bill before congress gives you a chance to do something about it, a chance to be tough and smart. what does that mean? let me begin by saying i care a lot about this issue. many years ago, when i started out in public life, i was the attorney general of my state. i served as  a governor for a dozen years. i know what it\\'s like to sign laws increasing penalties, to build more prison cells, to carry out the death penalty. i understand this issue. and it is not a simple thing. first, we must recognize that most violent crimes are committed by a small percentage of criminals who too often break the laws even when they are on parole. now those who commit crimes should be punished. and those who commit repeated, violent crimes should be told, \"when you commit a third violent crime, you will be put away, and put away for good. three strikes, and you are out.\" second, we must take serious steps to reduce violence and prevent crime, beginning with more police officers and more community policing. we know right now that police who work the streets, know the folks, have the respect of the neighborhood kids, focus on high crime areas, we know that they are more likely to prevent crime as well as catch criminals. look at the experience of houston, where the crime rate dropped 17 percent in one year when that approach was taken. here tonight is one of those community policemen, a brave, young detective, kevin jett, whose beat is eight square blocks in one of the toughest neighborhoods in new york. every day he restores some sanity and safety and a sense of values and connections to the people whose lives he protects. i\\'d like to ask him to stand  up and be recognized tonight. thank you, sir. [applause] you will be given a chance to give the children of this country, the law-abiding working people of this country—and don\\'t forget, in the toughest neighborhoods in this country, in the highest crime neighborhoods in this country, the vast majority of people get up every day and obey the law, pay their taxes, do their best to raise their kids. they deserve people like kevin jett. and you\\'re going to be given a chance to give the american people another 100,000 of them, well trained. and i urge you to do it. you have before you crime legislation which also establishes a police corps to encourage young people to get an education and pay it off by serving as police officers; which encourages retiring military personnel to move into police forces, an inordinate resource for our country; one which has a safe schools provision which will give our young people the chance to walk to school in safety and to be in school in safety instead of dodging bullets. these are important things. the third thing we have to do is to build on the brady bill, the brady law, to take further steps to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. i want to say something about this issue. hunters must always be free to hunt. law-abiding adults should always be free to own guns and protect their homes. i respect that part of our culture; i grew up in it. but i want to ask the sportsmen and others who lawfully own guns to join us in this campaign to reduce gun violence. i say to you, i know you didn\\'t create this problem, but we need your help to solve it. there is no sporting purpose on earth that should stop the united states congress from banishing assault weapons that out-gun police and cut down children. fourth, we must remember that drugs are a factor in an enormous percentage of crimes. recent studies indicate, sadly, that drug use is on the rise again among our young people. the crime bill contains—all the crime bills contain—more money for drug treatment for criminal addicts and boot camps for youthful offenders that include incentives to get off drugs and to stay off drugs. our administration\\'s budget, with all its cuts, contains a large increase in funding for drug treatment and drug education. you must pass them both. we need them desperately. my fellow americans, the problem of violence is an american problem. it has no partisan or philosophical element. therefore, i urge you to find ways as quickly as possible to set aside partisan differences and pass a strong, smart, tough crime bill. but further, i urge you to consider this: as you demand tougher penalties for those who choose violence, let us also remember how we came to this sad point. in our toughest neighborhoods, on our meanest streets, in our poorest rural areas, we have seen a stunning and simultaneous breakdown of community, family, and work, the heart and soul of civilized society. this has created a vast vacuum which has been filled by violence and drugs and gangs. so i ask you to remember  that even as we say \"no\" to crime, we must give people, especially our young people, something to say \"yes\" to. many of our initiatives, from job training to welfare reform to health care to national service, will help to rebuild distressed communities, to strengthen families, to provide work. but more needs to be done. that\\'s what our community empowerment agenda is all about, challenging businesses to provide more investment through empowerment zones, ensuring banks will make loans in the same communities their deposits come from, passing legislation to unleash the power of capital through community development banks to create jobs, opportunity, and hope where they\\'re needed most. i think you know that to really solve this problem, we\\'ll all have to put our heads together, leave our ideological armor aside, and find some new ideas to do even more. and let\\'s be honest, we all know something else too: our problems go way beyond the reach of government. they\\'re rooted in the loss of values, in the disappearance of work, and the breakdown of our families and our communities. my fellow americans, we can cut the deficit, create jobs, promote democracy around the world, pass welfare reform and health care, pass the toughest crime bill in history, but still leave too many of our people behind. the american people have got to want to change from within if we\\'re going to bring back work and family and community. we cannot renew our country when within a decade more than half of the children will be born into families where there has been no marriage. we cannot renew this country when 13-year-old boys get semi-automatic weapons to shoot 9-year-olds for kicks. we can\\'t renew our country when children are having children, and the fathers walk away as if the kids don\\'t amount to anything. we can\\'t renew the country when our businesses eagerly look for new investments and new customers abroad but ignore those people right here at home who would give anything to have their jobs and would gladly buy their products if they had the money to do it. we can\\'t renew our country unless more of usi mean, all of us—are willing to join the churches and the other good citizens, people like all the ministers i\\'ve worked with over the years or the priests and the nuns i met at our lady of help in east los angeles or my good friend tony campollo in philadelphia, unless we\\'re willing to work with people like that, people who are saving kids, adopting schools, making streets safer. all of us can do that. we can\\'t renew our country until we realize that governments don\\'t raise children, parents do. parents who know their children\\'s teachers and turn off the television and help with the homework and teach their kids right from wrong, those kinds of parents can make all the difference. i know, i had one. i\\'m telling you, we have got to stop pointing our fingers at these kids who have no future and reach our hands out to them. our country needs it, we need it, and they deserve it. so i say to you tonight, let\\'s give our children a future. let us take away their guns and give them books. let us overcome their despair and replace it with hope. let us, by our example, teach them to obey the law, respect our neighbors, and cherish our values. let us weave these sturdy threads into a new american community that can once more stand strong against the forces of despair and evil because everybody has a chance to walk into a better tomorrow. oh, there will be naysayers who fear that we won\\'t be equal to the challenges of this time. but they misread our history, our heritage. even today\\'s headlines, all those things tell us we can and we will overcome any challenge. when the earth shook and fires raged in california, when i saw the mississippi deluge the farmlands of the midwest in a 500-year flood, when the century\\'s bitterest cold swept from north dakota to newport news, it seemed as though the world itself was coming apart at the seams. but the american people, they just came together. they rose to the occasion, neighbor helping neighbor, strangers risking life and limb to save total strangers, showing the better angels of our nature. let us not reserve the better angels only for natural disasters, leaving our deepest and most profound problems to petty political fighting. let us instead be true to our spirit, facing facts, coming together, bringing hope, and moving forward. tonight, my fellow americans, we are summoned to answer a question as old as the republic itself: what is the state of our union? it is growing stronger, but it must be stronger still. with your help, and god\\'s help, it will be. thank you, and god bless america.'\n",
      " 'as a new congress gathers, all of us in the elected branches of government share a great privilege: we\\'ve been placed in office by the votes of the people we serve. and tonight that is a privilege we share with newly-elected leaders of afghanistan, the palestinian territories, ukraine, and a free and sovereign iraq. two weeks ago, i stood on the steps of this capitol and renewed the commitment of our nation to the guiding ideal of liberty for all. this evening i will set forth policies to advance that ideal at home and around the world.tonight, with a healthy, growing economy, with more americans going back to work, with our nation an active force for good in the world — the state of our union is confident and strong. our generation has been blessed — by the expansion of opportunity, by advances in medicine, by the security purchased by our parents\\' sacrifice. now, as we see a little gray in the mirror — or a lot of gray — and we watch our children moving into adulthood, we ask the question: what will be the state of their union? members of congress, the choices we make together will answer that question. over the next several months, on issue after issue, let us do what americans have always done, and build a better world for our children and our grandchildren. first, we must be good stewards of this economy, and renew the great institutions on which millions of our fellow citizens rely. america\\'s economy is the fastest growing of any major industrialized nation. in the past four years, we provided tax relief to every person who pays income taxes, overcome a recession, opened up new markets abroad, prosecuted corporate criminals, raised homeownership to its highest level in history, and in the last year alone, the united states has added 2.3 million new jobs.  when action was needed, the congress delivered — and the nation is grateful.now we must add to these achievements. by making our economy more flexible, more innovative, and more competitive, we will keep america the economic leader of the world. america\\'s prosperity requires restraining the spending appetite of the federal government. i welcome the bipartisan enthusiasm for spending discipline. i will send you a budget that holds the growth of discretionary spending below inflation, makes tax relief permanent, and stays on track to cut the deficit in half by 2009.  my budget substantially reduces or eliminates more than 150 government programs that are not getting results, or duplicate current efforts, or do not fulfill essential priorities. the principle here is clear: taxpayer dollars must be spent wisely, or not at all. to make our economy stronger and more dynamic, we must prepare a rising generation to fill the jobs of the 21st century. under the no child left behind act, standards are higher, test scores are on the rise, and we\\'re closing the achievement gap for minority students. now we must demand better results from our high schools, so every high school diploma is a ticket to success. we will help an additional 200,000 workers to get training for a better career, by reforming our job training system and strengthening america\\'s community colleges. and we\\'ll make it easier for americans to afford a college education, by increasing the size of pell grants. to make our economy stronger and more competitive, america must reward, not punish, the efforts and dreams of entrepreneurs. small business is the path of advancement, especially for women and minorities, so we must free small businesses from needless regulation and protect honest job-creators from junk lawsuits.  justice is distorted, and our economy is held back by irresponsible class-actions and frivolous asbestos claims — and i urge congress to pass legal reforms this year. to make our economy stronger and more productive, we must make health care more affordable, and give families greater access to good coverage — and more control over their health decisions.  i ask congress to move forward on a comprehensive health care agenda with tax credits to help low-income workers buy insurance, a community health center in every poor county, improved information technology to prevent medical error and needless costs, association health plans for small businesses and their employees —  — expanded health savings accounts — and medical liability reform that will reduce health care costs and make sure patients have the doctors and care they need. to keep our economy growing, we also need reliable supplies of affordable, environmentally responsible energy.  nearly four years ago, i submitted a comprehensive energy strategy that encourages conservation, alternative sources, a modernized electricity grid, and more production here at home — including safe, clean nuclear energy.  my clear skies legislation will cut power plant pollution and improve the health of our citizens.  and my budget provides strong funding for leading-edge technology — from hydrogen-fueled cars, to clean coal, to renewable sources such as ethanol.  four years of debate is enough: i urge congress to pass legislation that makes america more secure and less dependent on foreign energy. all these proposals are essential to expand this economy and add new jobs — but they are just the beginning of our duty. to build the prosperity of future generations, we must update institutions that were created to meet the needs of an earlier time. year after year, americans are burdened by an archaic, incoherent federal tax code. i\\'ve appointed a bipartisan panel to examine the tax code from top to bottom. and when their recommendations are delivered, you and i will work together to give this nation a tax code that is pro-growth, easy to understand, and fair to all. america\\'s immigration system is also outdated — unsuited to the needs of our economy and to the values of our country. we should not be content with laws that punish hardworking people who want only to provide for their families, and deny businesses willing workers, and invite chaos at our border. it is time for an immigration policy that permits temporary guest workers to fill jobs americans will not take, that rejects amnesty, that tells us who is entering and leaving our country, and that closes the border to drug dealers and terrorists. one of america\\'s most important institutions — a symbol of the trust between generations — is also in need of wise and effective reform. social security was a great moral success of the 20th century, and we must honor its great purposes in this new century.  the system, however, on its current path, is headed toward bankruptcy. and so we must join together to strengthen and save social security. today, more than 45 million americans receive social security benefits, and millions more are nearing retirement — and for them the system is sound and fiscally strong. i have a message for every american who is 55 or older: do not let anyone mislead you; for you, the social security system will not change in any way.  for younger workers, the social security system has serious problems that will grow worse with time. social security was created decades ago, for a very different era. in those days, people did not live as long. benefits were much lower than they are today. and a half-century ago, about sixteen workers paid into the system for each person drawing benefits.our society has changed in ways the founders of social security could not have foreseen. in today\\'s world, people are living longer and, therefore, drawing benefits longer. and those benefits are scheduled to rise dramatically over the next few decades. and instead of sixteen workers paying in for every beneficiary, right now it\\'s only about three workers. and over the next few decades that number will fall to just two workers per beneficiary. with each passing year, fewer workers are paying ever-higher benefits to an ever-larger number of retirees.so here is the result: thirteen years from now, in 2018, social security will be paying out more than it takes in. and every year afterward will bring a new shortfall, bigger than the year before. for example, in the year 2027, the government will somehow have to come up with an extra $200 billion to keep the system afloat — and by 2033, the annual shortfall would be more than $300 billion. by the year 2042, the entire system would be exhausted and bankrupt. if steps are not taken to avert that outcome, the only solutions would be dramatically higher taxes, massive new borrowing, or sudden and severe cuts in social security benefits or other government programs.i recognize that 2018 and 2042 may seem a long way off. but those dates are not so distant, as any parent will tell you. if you have a five-year-old, you\\'re already concerned about how you\\'ll pay for college tuition 13 years down the road. if you\\'ve got children in their 20s, as some of us do, the idea of social security collapsing before they retire does not seem like a small matter. and it should not be a small matter to the united states congress.  you and i share a responsibility. we must pass reforms that solve the financial problems of social security once and for all.fixing social security permanently will require an open, candid review of the options. some have suggested limiting benefits for wealthy retirees. former congressman tim penny has raised the possibility of indexing benefits to prices rather than wages. during the 1990s, my predecessor, president clinton, spoke of increasing the retirement age. former senator john breaux suggested discouraging early collection of social security benefits. the late senator daniel patrick moynihan recommended changing the way benefits are calculated. all these ideas are on the table.i know that none of these reforms would be easy. but we have to move ahead with courage and honesty, because our children\\'s retirement security is more important than partisan politics.  i will work with members of congress to find the most effective combination of reforms. i will listen to anyone who has a good idea to offer.  we must, however, be guided by some basic principles. we must make social security permanently sound, not leave that task for another day. we must not jeopardize our economic strength by increasing payroll taxes. we must ensure that lower-income americans get the help they need to have dignity and peace of mind in their retirement. we must guarantee there is no change for those now retired or nearing retirement. and we must take care that any changes in the system are gradual, so younger workers have years to prepare and plan for their future.as we fix social security, we also have the responsibility to make the system a better deal for younger workers. and the best way to reach that goal is through voluntary personal retirement accounts.  here is how the idea works. right now, a set portion of the money you earn is taken out of your paycheck to pay for the social security benefits of today\\'s retirees. if you\\'re a younger worker, i believe you should be able to set aside part of that money in your own retirement account, so you can build a nest egg for your own future.here\\'s why the personal accounts are a better deal. your money will grow, over time, at a greater rate than anything the current system can deliver — and your account will provide money for retirement over and above the check you will receive from social security. in addition, you\\'ll be able to pass along the money that accumulates in your personal account, if you wish, to your children and — or grandchildren. and best of all, the money in the account is yours, and the government can never take it away. the goal here is greater security in retirement, so we will set careful guidelines for personal accounts. we\\'ll make sure the money can only go into a conservative mix of bonds and stock funds. we\\'ll make sure that your earnings are not eaten up by hidden wall street fees. we\\'ll make sure there are good options to protect your investments from sudden market swings on the eve of your retirement. we\\'ll make sure a personal account cannot be emptied out all at once, but rather paid out over time, as an addition to traditional social security benefits. and we\\'ll make sure this plan is fiscally responsible, by starting personal retirement accounts gradually, and raising the yearly limits on contributions over time, eventually permitting all workers to set aside four percentage points of their payroll taxes in their accounts.personal retirement accounts should be familiar to federal employees, because you already have something similar, called the thrift savings plan, which lets workers deposit a portion of their paychecks into any of five different broadly-based investment funds. it\\'s time to extend the same security, and choice, and ownership to young americans. our second great responsibility to our children and grandchildren is to honor and to pass along the values that sustain a free society. so many of my generation, after a long journey, have come home to family and faith, and are determined to bring up responsible, moral children. government is not the source of these values, but government should never undermine them.because marriage is a sacred institution and the foundation of society, it should not be re-defined by activist judges. for the good of families, children, and society, i support a constitutional amendment to protect the institution of marriage. because a society is measured by how it treats the weak and vulnerable, we must strive to build a culture of life. medical research can help us reach that goal, by developing treatments and cures that save lives and help people overcome disabilities — and i thank the congress for doubling the funding of the national institutes of health.  to build a culture of life, we must also ensure that scientific advances always serve human dignity, not take advantage of some lives for the benefit of others. we should all be able to agree —  — we should all be able to agree on some clear standards. i will work with congress to ensure that human embryos are not created for experimentation or grown for body parts, and that human life is never bought and sold as a commodity.  america will continue to lead the world in medical research that is ambitious, aggressive, and always ethical.because courts must always deliver impartial justice, judges have a duty to faithfully interpret the law, not legislate from the bench.  as president, i have a constitutional responsibility to nominate men and women who understand the role of courts in our democracy, and are well-qualified to serve on the bench — and i have done so.  the constitution also gives the senate a responsibility: every judicial nominee deserves an up or down vote. because one of the deepest values of our country is compassion, we must never turn away from any citizen who feels isolated from the opportunities of america. our government will continue to support faith-based and community groups that bring hope to harsh places. now we need to focus on giving young people, especially young men in our cities, better options than apathy, or gangs, or jail. tonight i propose a three-year initiative to help organizations keep young people out of gangs, and show young men an ideal of manhood that respects women and rejects violence.  taking on gang life will be one part of a broader outreach to at-risk youth, which involves parents and pastors, coaches and community leaders, in programs ranging from literacy to sports. and i am proud that the leader of this nationwide effort will be our first lady, laura bush. because hiv/aids brings suffering and fear into so many lives, i ask you to reauthorize the ryan white act to encourage prevention, and provide care and treatment to the victims of that disease.  and as we update this important law, we must focus our efforts on fellow citizens with the highest rates of new cases, african american men and women. because one of the main sources of our national unity is our belief in equal justice, we need to make sure americans of all races and backgrounds have confidence in the system that provides justice. in america we must make doubly sure no person is held to account for a crime he or she did not commit — so we are dramatically expanding the use of dna evidence to prevent wrongful conviction.  soon i will send to congress a proposal to fund special training for defense counsel in capital cases, because people on trial for their lives must have competent lawyers by their side. our third responsibility to future generations is to leave them an america that is safe from danger, and protected by peace. we will pass along to our children all the freedoms we enjoy — and chief among them is freedom from fear.in the three and a half years since september the 11th, 2001, we have taken unprecedented actions to protect americans. we\\'ve created a new department of government to defend our homeland, focused the fbi on preventing terrorism, begun to reform our intelligence agencies, broken up terror cells across the country, expanded research on defenses against biological and chemical attack, improved border security, and trained more than a half-million first responders. police and firefighters, air marshals, researchers, and so many others are working every day to make our homeland safer, and we thank them all. our nation, working with allies and friends, has also confronted the enemy abroad, with measures that are determined, successful, and continuing. the al qaeda terror network that attacked our country still has leaders — but many of its top commanders have been removed. there are still governments that sponsor and harbor terrorists — but their number has declined. there are still regimes seeking weapons of mass destruction — but no longer without attention and without consequence. our country is still the target of terrorists who want to kill many, and intimidate us all — and we will stay on the offensive against them, until the fight is won. pursuing our enemies is a vital commitment of the war on terror — and i thank the congress for providing our servicemen and women with the resources they have needed. during this time of war, we must continue to support our military and give them the tools for victory. other nations around the globe have stood with us. in afghanistan, an international force is helping provide security. in iraq, 28 countries have troops on the ground, the united nations and the european union provided technical assistance for the elections, and nato is leading a mission to help train iraqi officers. we\\'re cooperating with 60 governments in the proliferation security initiative, to detect and stop the transit of dangerous materials. we\\'re working closely with the governments in asia to convince north korea to abandon its nuclear ambitions. pakistan, saudi arabia, and nine other countries have captured or detained al qaeda terrorists. in the next four years, my administration will continue to build the coalitions that will defeat the dangers of our time. in the long-term, the peace we seek will only be achieved by eliminating the conditions that feed radicalism and ideologies of murder. if whole regions of the world remain in despair and grow in hatred, they will be the recruiting grounds for terror, and that terror will stalk america and other free nations for decades. the only force powerful enough to stop the rise of tyranny and terror, and replace hatred with hope, is the force of human freedom.  our enemies know this, and that is why the terrorist zarqawi recently declared war on what he called the \"evil principle\" of democracy. and we\\'ve declared our own intention: america will stand with the allies of freedom to support democratic movements in the middle east and beyond, with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world. the united states has no right, no desire, and no intention to impose our form of government on anyone else. that is one of the main differences between us and our enemies. they seek to impose and expand an empire of oppression, in which a tiny group of brutal, self-appointed rulers control every aspect of every life. our aim is to build and preserve a community of free and independent nations, with governments that answer to their citizens, and reflect their own cultures. and because democracies respect their own people and their neighbors, the advance of freedom will lead to peace. that advance has great momentum in our time — shown by women voting in afghanistan, and palestinians choosing a new direction, and the people of ukraine asserting their democratic rights and electing a president. we are witnessing landmark events in the history of liberty. and in the coming years, we will add to that story. the beginnings of reform and democracy in the palestinian territories are now showing the power of freedom to break old patterns of violence and failure. tomorrow morning, secretary of state rice departs on a trip that will take her to israel and the west bank for meetings with prime minister sharon and president abbas. she will discuss with them how we and our friends can help the palestinian people end terror and build the institutions of a peaceful, independent, democratic state. to promote this democracy, i will ask congress for $350 million to support palestinian political, economic, and security reforms. the goal of two democratic states, israel and palestine, living side by side in peace, is within reach — and america will help them achieve that goal. to promote peace and stability in the broader middle east, the united states will work with our friends in the region to fight the common threat of terror, while we encourage a higher standard of freedom. hopeful reform is already taking hold in an arc from morocco to jordan to bahrain. the government of saudi arabia can demonstrate its leadership in the region by expanding the role of its people in determining their future. and the great and proud nation of egypt, which showed the way toward peace in the middle east, can now show the way toward democracy in the middle east. to promote peace in the broader middle east, we must confront regimes that continue to harbor terrorists and pursue weapons of mass murder. syria still allows its territory, and parts of lebanon, to be used by terrorists who seek to destroy every chance of peace in the region. you have passed, and we are applying, the syrian accountability act — and we expect the syrian government to end all support for terror and open the door to freedom.  today, iran remains the world\\'s primary state sponsor of terror — pursuing nuclear weapons while depriving its people of the freedom they seek and deserve. we are working with european allies to make clear to the iranian regime that it must give up its uranium enrichment program and any plutonium reprocessing, and end its support for terror. and to the iranian people, i say tonight: as you stand for your own liberty, america stands with you. our generational commitment to the advance of freedom, especially in the middle east, is now being tested and honored in iraq. that country is a vital front in the war on terror, which is why the terrorists have chosen to make a stand there. our men and women in uniform are fighting terrorists in iraq, so we do not have to face them here at home.  and the victory of freedom in iraq will strengthen a new ally in the war on terror, inspire democratic reformers from damascus to tehran, bring more hope and progress to a troubled region, and thereby lift a terrible threat from the lives of our children and grandchildren.we will succeed because the iraqi people value their own liberty — as they showed the world last sunday.  across iraq, often at great risk, millions of citizens went to the polls and elected 275 men and women to represent them in a new transitional national assembly. a young woman in baghdad told of waking to the sound of mortar fire on election day, and wondering if it might be too dangerous to vote. she said, \"hearing those explosions, it occurred to me — the insurgents are weak, they are afraid of democracy, they are losing. so i got my husband, and i got my parents, and we all came out and voted together.\"americans recognize that spirit of liberty, because we share it. in any nation, casting your vote is an act of civic responsibility; for millions of iraqis, it was also an act of personal courage, and they have earned the respect of us all. one of iraq\\'s leading democracy and human rights advocates is safia taleb al-suhail. she says of her country, \"we were occupied for 35 years by saddam hussein. that was the real occupation. thank you to the american people who paid the cost, but most of all, to the soldiers.\" eleven years ago, safia\\'s father was assassinated by saddam\\'s intelligence service. three days ago in baghdad, safia was finally able to vote for the leaders of her country — and we are honored that she is with us tonight. the terrorists and insurgents are violently opposed to democracy, and will continue to attack it. yet, the terrorists\\' most powerful myth is being destroyed. the whole world is seeing that the car bombers and assassins are not only fighting coalition forces, they are trying to destroy the hopes of iraqis, expressed in free elections. and the whole world now knows that a small group of extremists will not overturn the will of the iraqi people. we will succeed in iraq because iraqis are determined to fight for their own freedom, and to write their own history. as prime minister allawi said in his speech to congress last september, \"ordinary iraqis are anxious to shoulder all the security burdens of our country as quickly as possible.\" that is the natural desire of an independent nation, and it is also the stated mission of our coalition in iraq. the new political situation in iraq opens a new phase of our work in that country.at the recommendation of our commanders on the ground, and in consultation with the iraqi government, we will increasingly focus our efforts on helping prepare more capable iraqi security forces — forces with skilled officers and an effective command structure. as those forces become more self-reliant and take on greater security responsibilities, america and its coalition partners will increasingly be in a supporting role. in the end, iraqis must be able to defend their own country — and we will help that proud, new nation secure its liberty.recently an iraqi interpreter said to a reporter, \"tell america not to abandon us.\" he and all iraqis can be certain: while our military strategy is adapting to circumstances, our commitment remains firm and unchanging. we are standing for the freedom of our iraqi friends, and freedom in iraq will make america safer for generations to come. we will not set an artificial timetable for leaving iraq, because that would embolden the terrorists and make them believe they can wait us out. we are in iraq to achieve a result: a country that is democratic, representative of all its people, at peace with its neighbors, and able to defend itself. and when that result is achieved, our men and women serving in iraq will return home with the honor they have earned. right now, americans in uniform are serving at posts across the world, often taking great risks on my orders. we have given them training and equipment; and they have given us an example of idealism and character that makes every american proud. the volunteers of our military are unrelenting in battle, unwavering in loyalty, unmatched in honor and decency, and every day they\\'re making our nation more secure. some of our servicemen and women have survived terrible injuries, and this grateful country will do everything we can to help them recover. and we have said farewell to some very good men and women, who died for our freedom, and whose memory this nation will honor forever.one name we honor is marine corps sergeant byron norwood of pflugerville, texas, who was killed during the assault on fallujah. his mom, janet, sent me a letter and told me how much byron loved being a marine, and how proud he was to be on the front line against terror. she wrote, \"when byron was home the last time, i said that i wanted to protect him like i had since he was born. he just hugged me and said, \\'you\\'ve done your job, mom. now it is my turn to protect you.\\'\" ladies and gentlemen, with grateful hearts, we honor freedom\\'s defenders, and our military families, represented here this evening by sergeant norwood\\'s mom and dad, janet and bill norwood. in these four years, americans have seen the unfolding of large events. we have known times of sorrow, and hours of uncertainty, and days of victory. in all this history, even when we have disagreed, we have seen threads of purpose that unite us. the attack on freedom in our world has reaffirmed our confidence in freedom\\'s power to change the world. we are all part of a great venture: to extend the promise of freedom in our country, to renew the values that sustain our liberty, and to spread the peace that freedom brings.as franklin roosevelt once reminded americans, \"each age is a dream that is dying, or one that is coming to birth.\" and we live in the country where the biggest dreams are born. the abolition of slavery was only a dream — until it was fulfilled. the liberation of europe from fascism was only a dream — until it was achieved. the fall of imperial communism was only a dream — until, one day, it was accomplished. our generation has dreams of its own, and we also go forward with confidence. the road of providence is uneven and unpredictable — yet we know where it leads: it leads to freedom.thank you, and may god bless america.'\n",
      " 'mr. speaker, vice president cheney, members of congress, members of the supreme court and diplomatic corps, distinguished guests, and fellow citizens:today our nation lost a beloved, graceful, courageous woman who called america to its founding ideals and carried on a noble dream. tonight we are comforted by the hope of a glad reunion with the husband who was taken from her so long ago, and we are grateful for the good life of coretta scott king.each time i am invited to this rostrum, i am humbled by the privilege, and mindful of the history we have seen together. we have gathered under this capitol dome in moments of national mourning and national achievement. we have served america through one of the most consequential periods of our history – and it has been my honor to serve with you.in a system of two parties, two chambers, and two elected branches, there will always be differences and debate. but even tough debates can be conducted in a civil tone, and our differences cannot be allowed to harden into anger. to confront the great issues before us, we must act in a spirit of good will and respect for one another – and i will do my part.  tonight the state of our union is strong – and together we will make it stronger.in this decisive year, you and i will make choices that determine both the future and the character of our country. we will choose to act confidently in pursuing the enemies of freedom – or retreat from our duties in the hope of an easier life. we will choose to build our prosperity by leading the world economy – or shut ourselves off from trade and opportunity. in a complex and challenging time, the road of isolationism and protectionism may seem broad and inviting – yet it ends in danger and decline. the only way to protect our people … the only way to secure the peace … the only way to control our destiny is by our leadership – so the united states of america will continue to lead.abroad, our nation is committed to an historic, long-term goal – we seek the end of tyranny in our world. some dismiss that goal as misguided idealism. in reality, the future security of america depends on it. on september 11th, 2001, we found that problems originating in a failed and oppressive state seven thousand miles away could bring murder and destruction to our country. dictatorships shelter terrorists, feed resentment and radicalism, and seek weapons of mass destruction.  democracies replace resentment with hope, respect the rights of their citizens and their neighbors, and join the fight against terror. every step toward freedom in the world makes our country safer, and so we will act boldly in freedom’s cause.far from being a hopeless dream, the advance of freedom is the great story of our time. in 1945, there were about two dozen lonely democracies on earth. today, there are 122. and we are writing a new chapter in the story of self-government – with women lining up to vote in afghanistan … and millions of iraqis marking their liberty with purple ink … and men and women from lebanon to egypt debating the rights of individuals and the necessity of freedom. at the start of 2006, more than half the people of our world live in democratic nations. and we do not forget the other half – in places like syria, burma, zimbabwe, north korea, and iran – because the demands of justice, and the peace of this world, require their freedom as well.no one can deny the success of freedom, but some men rage and fight against it. and one of the main sources of reaction and opposition is radical islam – the perversion by a few of a noble faith into an ideology of terror and death. terrorists like bin laden are serious about mass murder – and all of us must take their declared intentions seriously.  they seek to impose a heartless system of totalitarian control throughout the middle east, and arm themselves with weapons of mass murder. their aim is to seize power in iraq, and use it as a safe haven to launch attacks against america and the world. lacking the military strength to challenge us directly, the terrorists have chosen the weapon of fear.  when they murder children at a school in beslan … or blow up commuters in london … or behead a bound captive … the terrorists hope these horrors will break our will, allowing the violent to inherit the earth. but they have miscalculated: we love our freedom, and we will fight to keep it.in a time of testing, we cannot find security by abandoning our commitments and retreating within our borders. if we were to leave these vicious attackers alone, they would not leave us alone. they would simply move the battlefield to our own shores. there is no peace in retreat.  and there is no honor in retreat. by allowing radical islam to work its will – by leaving an assaulted world to fend for itself – we would signal to all that we no longer believe in our own ideals, or even in our own courage. but our enemies and our friends can be certain: the united states will not retreat from the world, and we will never surrender to evil.america rejects the false comfort of isolationism. we are the nation that saved liberty in europe, and liberated death camps, and helped raise up democracies, and faced down an evil empire. once again, we accept the call of history to deliver the oppressed, and move this world toward peace.we remain on the offensive against terror networks. we have killed or captured many of their leaders – and for the others, their day will come.we remain on the offensive in afghanistan – where a fine president and national assembly are fighting terror while building the institutions of a new democracy.and we are on the offensive in iraq, with a clear plan for victory.  first, we are helping iraqis build an inclusive government, so that old resentments will be eased, and the insurgency marginalized. second, we are continuing reconstruction efforts, and helping the iraqi government to fight corruption and build a modern economy, so all iraqis can experience the benefits of freedom. third, we are striking terrorist targets while we train iraqi forces that are increasingly capable of defeating the enemy. iraqis are showing their courage every day, and we are proud to be their allies in the cause of freedom.our work in iraq is difficult, because our enemy is brutal. but that brutality has not stopped the dramatic progress of a new democracy. in less than three years, that nation has gone from dictatorship, to liberation, to sovereignty, to a constitution, to national elections. at the same time, our coalition has been relentless in shutting off terrorist infiltration, clearing out insurgent strongholds, and turning over territory to iraqi security forces. i am confident in our plan for victory … i am confident in the will of the iraqi people … i am confident in the skill and spirit of our military. fellow citizens, we are in this fight to win, and we are winning.the road of victory is the road that will take our troops home. as we make progress on the ground, and iraqi forces increasingly take the lead, we should be able to further decrease our troop levels – but those decisions will be made by our military commanders, not by politicians in washington, d.c.our coalition has learned from experience in iraq. we have adjusted our military tactics and changed our approach to reconstruction. along the way, we have benefited from responsible criticism and counsel offered by members of congress of both parties. in the coming year, i will continue to reach out and seek your good advice.yet there is a difference between responsible criticism that aims for success, and defeatism that refuses to acknowledge anything but failure.  hindsight alone is not wisdom. and second-guessing is not a strategy.with so much in the balance, those of us in public office have a duty to speak with candor. a sudden withdrawal of our forces from iraq would abandon our iraqi allies to death and prison … put men like bin laden and zarqawi in charge of a strategic country … and show that a pledge from america means little. members of congress: however we feel about the decisions and debates of the past, our nation has only one option: we must keep our word, defeat our enemies, and stand behind the american military in its vital mission.our men and women in uniform are making sacrifices – and showing a sense of duty stronger than all fear. they know what it is like to fight house to house in a maze of streets … to wear heavy gear in the desert heat … to see a comrade killed by a roadside bomb. and those who know the costs also know the stakes. marine staff sergeant dan clay was killed last month fighting the enemy in fallujah. he left behind a letter to his family, but his words could just as well be addressed to every american.  here is what dan wrote: “i know what honor is. it has been an honor to protect and serve all of you. i faced death with the secure knowledge that you would not have to…. never falter! don’t hesitate to honor and support those of us who have the honor of protecting that which is worth protecting.”staff sergeant dan clay’s wife, lisa, and his mom and dad, sara jo and bud, are with us this evening. our nation is grateful to the fallen, who live in the memory of our country. we are grateful to all who volunteer to wear our nation’s uniform – and as we honor our brave troops, let us never forget the sacrifices of america’s military families.our offensive against terror involves more than military action.  ultimately, the only way to defeat the terrorists is to defeat their dark vision of hatred and fear by offering the hopeful alternative of political freedom and peaceful change. so the united states of america supports democratic reform across the broader middle east. elections are vital – but they are only the beginning. raising up a democracy requires the rule of law, protection of minorities, and strong, accountable institutions that last longer than a single vote. the great people of egypt have voted in a multi-party presidential election – and now their government should open paths of peaceful opposition that will reduce the appeal of radicalism. the palestinian people have voted in elections – now the leaders of hamas must recognize israel, disarm, reject terrorism, and work for lasting peace. saudi arabia has taken the first steps of reform – now it can offer its people a better future by pressing forward with those efforts. democracies in the middle east will not look like our own, because they will reflect the traditions of their own citizens. yet liberty is the future of every nation in the middle east, because liberty is the right and hope of all humanity.the same is true of iran, a nation now held hostage by a small clerical elite that is isolating and repressing its people. the regime in that country sponsors terrorists in the palestinian territories and in lebanon – and that must come to an end. the iranian government is defying the world with its nuclear ambitions – and the nations of the world must not permit the iranian regime to gain nuclear weapons. america will continue to rally the world to confront these threats. and tonight, let me speak directly to the citizens of iran: america respects you, and we respect your country. we respect your right to choose your own future and win your own freedom. and our nation hopes one day to be the closest of friends with a free and democratic iran.to overcome dangers in our world, we must also take the offensive by encouraging economic progress, fighting disease, and spreading hope in hopeless lands. isolationism would not only tie our hands in fighting enemies, it would keep us from helping our friends in desperate need. we show compassion abroad because americans believe in the god-given dignity and worth of a villager with hiv/aids, or an infant with malaria, or a refugee fleeing genocide, or a young girl sold into slavery. we also show compassion abroad because regions overwhelmed by poverty, corruption, and despair are sources of terrorism, organized crime, human trafficking, and the drug trade.in recent years, you and i have taken unprecedented action to fight aids and malaria, expand the education of girls, and reward developing nations that are moving forward with economic and political reform. for people everywhere, the united states is a partner for a better life.  short-changing these efforts would increase the suffering and chaos of our world, undercut our long-term security, and dull the conscience of our country. i urge members of congress to serve the interests of america by showing the compassion of america.our country must also remain on the offensive against terrorism here at home. the enemy has not lost the desire or capability to attack us.  fortunately, this nation has superb professionals in law enforcement, intelligence, the military, and homeland security. these men and women are dedicating their lives to protecting us all, and they deserve our support and our thanks. they also deserve the same tools they already use to fight drug trafficking and organized crime – so i ask you to reauthorize the patriot act.it is said that prior to the attacks of september 11th, our government failed to connect the dots of the conspiracy. we now know that two of the hijackers in the united states placed telephone calls to al-qaida operatives overseas. but we did not know about their plans until it was too late. so to prevent another attack – based on authority given to me by the constitution and by statute – i have authorized a terrorist surveillance program to aggressively pursue the international communications of suspected al-qaida operatives and affiliates to and from america. previous presidents have used the same constitutional authority i have – and federal courts have approved the use of that authority.  appropriate members of congress have been kept informed. this terrorist surveillance program has helped prevent terrorist attacks. it remains essential to the security of america. if there are people inside our country who are talking with al-qaida, we want to know about it – because we will not sit back and wait to be hit again.in all these areas – from the disruption of terror networks, to victory in iraq, to the spread of freedom and hope in troubled regions – we need the support of friends and allies. to draw that support, we must always be clear in our principles and willing to act. the only alternative to american leadership is a dramatically more dangerous and anxious world.  yet we also choose to lead because it is a privilege to serve the values that gave us birth. american leaders – from roosevelt to truman to kennedy to reagan – rejected isolation and retreat, because they knew that america is always more secure when freedom is on the march. our own generation is in a long war against a determined enemy – a war that will be fought by presidents of both parties, who will need steady bipartisan support from the congress. and tonight i ask for yours. together, let us protect our country, support the men and women who defend us, and lead this world toward freedom.here at home, america also has a great opportunity: we will build the prosperity of our country by strengthening our economic leadership in the world.our economy is healthy, and vigorous, and growing faster than other major industrialized nations. in the last two-and-a-half years, america has created 4.6 million new jobs – more than japan and the european union combined. even in the face of higher energy prices and natural disasters, the american people have turned in an economic performance that is the envy of the world.the american economy is pre-eminent – but we cannot afford to be complacent. in a dynamic world economy, we are seeing new competitors like china and india. this creates uncertainty, which makes it easier to feed people’s fears. and so we are seeing some old temptations return.  protectionists want to escape competition, pretending that we can keep our high standard of living while walling off our economy. others say that the government needs to take a larger role in directing the economy, centralizing more power in washington and increasing taxes. we hear claims that immigrants are somehow bad for the economy – even though this economy could not function without them. all these are forms of economic retreat, and they lead in the same direction – toward a stagnant and second-rate economy.tonight i will set out a better path – an agenda for a nation that competes with confidence – an agenda that will raise standards of living and generate new jobs. americans should not fear our economic future, because we intend to shape it.keeping america competitive begins with keeping our economy growing. and our economy grows when americans have more of their own money to spend, save, and invest. in the last five years, the tax relief you passed has left 880 billion dollars in the hands of american workers, investors, small businesses, and families – and they have used it to help produce more than four years of uninterrupted economic growth. yet the tax relief is set to expire in the next few years. if we do nothing, american families will face a massive tax increase they do not expect and will not welcome.because america needs more than a temporary expansion, we need more than temporary tax relief. i urge the congress to act responsibly, and make the tax cuts permanent.keeping america competitive requires us to be good stewards of tax dollars. every year of my presidency, we have reduced the growth of non-security discretionary spending – and last year you passed bills that cut this spending. this year my budget will cut it again, and reduce or eliminate more than 140 programs that are performing poorly or not fulfilling essential priorities. by passing these reforms, we will save the american taxpayer another 14 billion dollars next year – and stay on track to cut the deficit in half by 2009. i am pleased that members of congress are working on earmark reform – because the federal budget has too many special interest projects. and we can tackle this problem together, if you pass the line-item veto.we must also confront the larger challenge of mandatory spending, or entitlements. this year, the first of about 78 million baby boomers turn 60, including two of my dad’s favorite people – me, and president bill clinton. this milestone is more than a personal crisis – it is a national challenge. the retirement of the baby boom generation will put unprecedented strains on the federal government. by 2030, spending for social security, medicare, and medicaid alone will be almost 60 percent of the entire federal budget. and that will present future congresses with impossible choices – staggering tax increases, immense deficits, or deep cuts in every category of spending.congress did not act last year on my proposal to save social security, yet the rising cost of entitlements is a problem that is not going away – and with every year we fail to act, the situation gets worse. so tonight, i ask you to join me in creating a commission to examine the full impact of baby boom retirements on social security, medicare, and medicaid. this commission should include members of congress of both parties, and offer bipartisan answers. we need to put aside partisan politics, work together, and get this problem solved.keeping america competitive requires us to open more markets for all that americans make and grow. one out of every five factory jobs in america is related to global trade, and we want people everywhere to buy american.  with open markets and a level playing field, no one can out-produce or out-compete the american worker.keeping america competitive requires an immigration system that upholds our laws, reflects our values, and serves the interests of our economy.  our nation needs orderly and secure borders. to meet this goal, we must have stronger immigration enforcement and border protection. and we must have a rational, humane guest worker program that rejects amnesty … allows temporary jobs for people who seek them legally … and reduces smuggling and crime at the border.keeping america competitive requires affordable health care. our government has a responsibility to help provide health care for the poor and the elderly, and we are meeting that responsibility. for all americans, we must confront the rising cost of care … strengthen the doctor-patient relationship … and help people afford the insurance coverage they need. we will make wider use of electronic records and other health information technology, to help control costs and reduce dangerous medical errors. we will strengthen health savings accounts – by making sure individuals and small business employees can buy insurance with the same advantages that people working for big businesses now get.  we will do more to make this coverage portable, so workers can switch jobs without having to worry about losing their health insurance. and because lawsuits are driving many good doctors out of practice – leaving women in nearly 1,500 american counties without a single ob-gyn – i ask the congress to pass medical liability reform this year.keeping america competitive requires affordable energy. here we have a serious problem: america is addicted to oil, which is often imported from unstable parts of the world.the best way to break this addiction is through technology. since 2001, we have spent nearly 10 billion dollars to develop cleaner, cheaper, more reliable alternative energy sources – and we are on the threshold of incredible advances. so tonight, i announce the advanced energy initiative – a 22-percent increase in clean-energy research at the department of energy, to push for breakthroughs in two vital areas. to change how we power our homes and offices, we will invest more in zero-emission coal-fired plants; revolutionary solar and wind technologies; and clean, safe nuclear energy.we must also change how we power our automobiles. we will increase our research in better batteries for hybrid and electric cars, and in pollution-free cars that run on hydrogen. we will also fund additional research in cutting-edge methods of producing ethanol, not just from corn but from wood chips, stalks, or switch grass. our goal is to make this new kind of ethanol practical and competitive within six years.  breakthroughs on this and other new technologies will help us reach another great goal: to replace more than 75 percent of our oil imports from the middle east by 2025. by applying the talent and technology of america, this country can dramatically improve our environment … move beyond a petroleum-based economy … and make our dependence on middle eastern oil a thing of the past.and to keep america competitive, one commitment is necessary above all: we must continue to lead the world in human talent and creativity. our greatest advantage in the world has always been our educated, hard-working, ambitious people – and we are going to keep that edge.  tonight i announce the american competitiveness initiative, to encourage innovation throughout our economy, and to give our nation’s children a firm grounding in math and science.first: i propose to double the federal commitment to the most critical basic research programs in the physical sciences over the next ten years.  this funding will support the work of america’s most creative minds as they explore promising areas such as nanotechnology, supercomputing, and alternative energy sources.second: i propose to make permanent the research and development tax credit, to encourage bolder private-sector investment in technology. with more research in both the public and private sectors, we will improve our quality of life – and ensure that america will lead the world in opportunity and innovation for decades to come.third: we need to encourage children to take more math and science, and make sure those courses are rigorous enough to compete with other nations.  we have made a good start in the early grades with the no child left behind act, which is raising standards and lifting test scores across our country. tonight i propose to train 70,000 high school teachers, to lead advanced-placement courses in math and science … bring 30,000 math and science professionals to teach in classrooms … and give early help to students who struggle with math, so they have a better chance at good, high-wage jobs. if we ensure that america’s children succeed in life, they will ensure that america succeeds in the world.preparing our nation to compete in the world is a goal that all of us can share. i urge you to support the american competitiveness initiative … and together we will show the world what the american people can achieve.america is a great force for freedom and prosperity. yet our greatness is not measured in power or luxuries, but by who we are and how we treat one another. so we strive to be a compassionate, decent, hopeful society.in recent years, america has become a more hopeful nation. violent crime rates have fallen to their lowest levels since the 1970s. welfare cases have dropped by more than half over the past decade. drug use among youth is down 19 percent since 2001. there are fewer abortions in america than at any point in the last three decades, and the number of children born to teenage mothers has been falling for a dozen years in a row.these gains are evidence of a quiet transformation – a revolution of conscience, in which a rising generation is finding that a life of personal responsibility is a life of fulfillment. government has played a role. wise policies such as welfare reform, drug education, and support for abstinence and adoption have made a difference in the character of our country. and everyone here tonight, democrat and republican, has a right to be proud of this record.yet many americans, especially parents, still have deep concerns about the direction of our culture, and the health of our most basic institutions.  they are concerned about unethical conduct by public officials, and discouraged by activist courts that try to redefine marriage. and they worry about children in our society who need direction and love … and about fellow citizens still displaced by natural disaster … and about suffering caused by treatable diseases.as we look at these challenges, we must never give in to the belief that america is in decline, or that our culture is doomed to unravel. the american people know better than that. we have proven the pessimists wrong before – and we will do it again.a hopeful society depends on courts that deliver equal justice under law.  the supreme court now has two superb new members, chief justice john roberts and justice sam alito. i thank the senate for confirming both of them. and i will continue to nominate men and women who understand that judges must be servants of the law, and not legislate from the bench.  today marks the official retirement of a very special american. for 24 years of faithful service to our nation, the united states is grateful to justice sandra day o’connor.a hopeful society has institutions of science and medicine that do not cut ethical corners, and that recognize the matchless value of every life.  tonight i ask you to pass legislation to prohibit the most egregious abuses of medical research – human cloning in all its forms … creating or implanting embryos for experiments … creating human-animal hybrids … and buying, selling, or patenting human embryos. human life is a gift from our creator – and that gift should never be discarded, devalued, or put up for sale.a hopeful society expects elected officials to uphold the public trust.  honorable people in both parties are working on reforms to strengthen the ethical standards of washington – and i support your efforts. each of us has made a pledge to be worthy of public responsibility – and that is a pledge we must never forget, never dismiss, and never betray.as we renew the promise of our institutions, let us also show the character of america in our compassion and care for one another.a hopeful society gives special attention to children who lack direction and love. through the helping america’s youth initiative, we are encouraging caring adults to get involved in the life of a child – and this good work is led by our first lady, laura bush. this year we will add resources to encourage young people to stay in school – so more of america’s youth can raise their sights and achieve their dreams.a hopeful society comes to the aid of fellow citizens in times of suffering and emergency – and stays at it until they are back on their feet. so far the federal government has committed 85 billion dollars to the people of the gulf coast and new orleans. we are removing debris, repairing highways, and building stronger levees. we are providing business loans and housing assistance. yet as we meet these immediate needs, we must also address deeper challenges that existed before the storm arrived. in new orleans and in other places, many of our fellow citizens have felt excluded from the promise of our country. the answer is not only temporary relief, but schools that teach every child … and job skills that bring upward mobility … and more opportunities to own a home and start a business. as we recover from a disaster, let us also work for the day when all americans are protected by justice, equal in hope, and rich in opportunity.a hopeful society acts boldly to fight diseases like hiv/aids, which can be prevented, and treated, and defeated. more than a million americans live with hiv, and half of all aids cases occur among african-americans.  i ask congress to reform and reauthorize the ryan white act … and provide new funding to states, so we end the waiting lists for aids medicine in america. we will also lead a nationwide effort, working closely with african-american churches and faith-based groups, to deliver rapid hiv tests to millions, end the stigma of aids, and come closer to the day when there are no new infections in america.fellow citizens, we have been called to leadership in a period of consequence. we have entered a great ideological conflict we did nothing to invite. we see great changes in science and commerce that will influence all our lives. and sometimes it can seem that history is turning in a wide arc, toward an unknown shore.yet the destination of history is determined by human action, and every great movement of history comes to a point of choosing. lincoln could have accepted peace at the cost of disunity and continued slavery. martin luther king could have stopped at birmingham or at selma, and achieved only half a victory over segregation. the united states could have accepted the permanent division of europe, and been complicit in the oppression of others. today, having come far in our own historical journey, we must decide: will we turn back, or finish well?before history is written down in books, it is written in courage.  like americans before us, we will show that courage and we will finish well. we will lead freedom’s advance. we will compete and excel in the global economy. we will renew the defining moral commitments of this land. and so we move forward – optimistic about our country, faithful to its cause, and confident of victories to come.thank you, god bless you, and may god bless america.'\n",
      " 'thank you very much. and tonight, i have a high privilege and distinct honor of my own — as the first president to begin the state of the union message with these words: madam speaker (applause.)in his day, the late congressman thomas d\\'alesandro, jr. from baltimore, maryland, saw presidents roosevelt and truman at this rostrum. but nothing could compare with the sight of his only daughter, nancy, presiding tonight as speaker of the house of representatives. (applause.) congratulations, madam speaker. (applause.) two members of the house and senate are not with us tonight, and we pray for the recovery and speedy return of senator tim johnson and congressman charlie norwood. (applause.) madam speaker, vice president cheney, members of congress, distinguished guests, and fellow citizens: the rite of custom brings us together at a defining hour — when decisions are hard and courage is needed. we enter the year 2007 with large endeavors underway, and others that are ours to begin. in all of this, much is asked of us. we must have the will to face difficult challenges and determined enemies — and the wisdom to face them together. some in this chamber are new to the house and the senate — and i congratulate the democrat majority. (applause.) congress has changed, but not our responsibilities. each of us is guided by our own convictions — and to these we must stay faithful. yet we\\'re all held to the same standards, and called to serve the same good purposes: to extend this nation\\'s prosperity; to spend the people\\'s money wisely; to solve problems, not leave them to future generations; to guard america against all evil; and to keep faith with those we have sent forth to defend us. (applause.) we\\'re not the first to come here with a government divided and uncertainty in the air. like many before us, we can work through our differences, and achieve big things for the american people. our citizens don\\'t much care which side of the aisle we sit on — as long as we\\'re willing to cross that aisle when there is work to be done. (applause.) our job is to make life better for our fellow americans, and to help them to build a future of hope and opportunity — and this is the business before us tonight. a future of hope and opportunity begins with a growing economy — and that is what we have. we\\'re now in the 41st month of uninterrupted job growth, in a recovery that has created 7.2 million new jobs — so far. unemployment is low, inflation is low, and wages are rising. this economy is on the move, and our job is to keep it that way, not with more government, but with more enterprise. (applause.) next week, i\\'ll deliver a full report on the state of our economy. tonight, i want to discuss three economic reforms that deserve to be priorities for this congress. first, we must balance the federal budget. (applause.) we can do so without raising taxes. (applause.) what we need is impose spending discipline in washington, d.c. we set a goal of cutting the deficit in half by 2009, and met that goal three years ahead of schedule. (applause.) now let us take the next step. in the coming weeks, i will submit a budget that eliminates the federal deficit within the next five years. (applause.) i ask you to make the same commitment. together, we can restrain the spending appetite of the federal government, and we can balance the federal budget. (applause.) next, there is the matter of earmarks. these special interest items are often slipped into bills at the last hour — when not even c-span is watching. (laughter.) in 2005 alone, the number of earmarks grew to over 13,000 and totaled nearly $18 billion. even worse, over 90 percent of earmarks never make it to the floor of the house and senate — they are dropped into committee reports that are not even part of the bill that arrives on my desk. you didn\\'t vote them into law. i didn\\'t sign them into law. yet, they\\'re treated as if they have the force of law. the time has come to end this practice. so let us work together to reform the budget process, expose every earmark to the light of day and to a vote in congress, and cut the number and cost of earmarks at least in half by the end of this session. (applause.) and, finally, to keep this economy strong we must take on the challenge of entitlements. social security and medicare and medicaid are commitments of conscience, and so it is our duty to keep them permanently sound. yet, we\\'re failing in that duty. and this failure will one day leave our children with three bad options: huge tax increases, huge deficits, or huge and immediate cuts in benefits. everyone in this chamber knows this to be true — yet somehow we have not found it in ourselves to act. so let us work together and do it now. with enough good sense and goodwill, you and i can fix medicare and medicaid — and save social security. (applause.) spreading opportunity and hope in america also requires public schools that give children the knowledge and character they need in life. five years ago, we rose above partisan differences to pass the no child left behind act, preserving local control, raising standards, and holding those schools accountable for results. and because we acted, students are performing better in reading and math, and minority students are closing the achievement gap. now the task is to build on the success, without watering down standards, without taking control from local communities, and without backsliding and calling it reform. we can lift student achievement even higher by giving local leaders flexibility to turn around failing schools, and by giving families with children stuck in failing schools the right to choose someplace better. (applause.) we must increase funds for students who struggle — and make sure these children get the special help they need. (applause.) and we can make sure our children are prepared for the jobs of the future and our country is more competitive by strengthening math and science skills. the no child left behind act has worked for america\\'s children — and i ask congress to reauthorize this good law. (applause.) a future of hope and opportunity requires that all our citizens have affordable and available health care. (applause.) when it comes to health care, government has an obligation to care for the elderly, the disabled, and poor children. and we will meet those responsibilities. for all other americans, private health insurance is the best way to meet their needs. (applause.) but many americans cannot afford a health insurance policy. and so tonight, i propose two new initiatives to help more americans afford their own insurance. first, i propose a standard tax deduction for health insurance that will be like the standard tax deduction for dependents. families with health insurance will pay no income on payroll tax — or payroll taxes on $15,000 of their income. single americans with health insurance will pay no income or payroll taxes on $7,500 of their income. with this reform, more than 100 million men, women, and children who are now covered by employer-provided insurance will benefit from lower tax bills. at the same time, this reform will level the playing field for those who do not get health insurance through their job. for americans who now purchase health insurance on their own, this proposal would mean a substantial tax savings — $4,500 for a family of four making $60,000 a year. and for the millions of other americans who have no health insurance at all, this deduction would help put a basic private health insurance plan within their reach. changing the tax code is a vital and necessary step to making health care affordable for more americans. (applause.)my second proposal is to help the states that are coming up with innovative ways to cover the uninsured. states that make basic private health insurance available to all their citizens should receive federal funds to help them provide this coverage to the poor and the sick. i have asked the secretary of health and human services to work with congress to take existing federal funds and use them to create \"affordable choices\" grants. these grants would give our nation\\'s governors more money and more flexibility to get private health insurance to those most in need. there are many other ways that congress can help. we need to expand health savings accounts. (applause.) we need to help small businesses through association health plans. (applause.) we need to reduce costs and medical errors with better information technology. (applause.) we will encourage price transparency. and to protect good doctors from junk lawsuits, we passing medical liability reform. (applause.) in all we do, we must remember that the best health care decisions are made not by government and insurance companies, but by patients and their doctors. (applause.) extending hope and opportunity in our country requires an immigration system worthy of america — with laws that are fair and borders that are secure. when laws and borders are routinely violated, this harms the interests of our country. to secure our border, we\\'re doubling the size of the border patrol, and funding new infrastructure and technology. yet even with all these steps, we cannot fully secure the border unless we take pressure off the border — and that requires a temporary worker program. we should establish a legal and orderly path for foreign workers to enter our country to work on a temporary basis. as a result, they won\\'t have to try to sneak in, and that will leave border agents free to chase down drug smugglers and criminals and terrorists. (applause.) we\\'ll enforce our immigration laws at the work site and give employers the tools to verify the legal status of their workers, so there\\'s no excuse left for violating the law. (applause.) we need to uphold the great tradition of the melting pot that welcomes and assimilates new arrivals. (applause.) we need to resolve the status of the illegal immigrants who are already in our country without animosity and without amnesty. (applause.) convictions run deep in this capitol when it comes to immigration. let us have a serious, civil, and conclusive debate, so that you can pass, and i can sign, comprehensive immigration reform into law. (applause.) extending hope and opportunity depends on a stable supply of energy that keeps america\\'s economy running and america\\'s environment clean. for too long our nation has been dependent on foreign oil. and this dependence leaves us more vulnerable to hostile regimes, and to terrorists — who could cause huge disruptions of oil shipments, and raise the price of oil, and do great harm to our economy. it\\'s in our vital interest to diversify america\\'s energy supply — the way forward is through technology. we must continue changing the way america generates electric power, by even greater use of clean coal technology, solar and wind energy, and clean, safe nuclear power. (applause.) we need to press on with battery research for plug-in and hybrid vehicles, and expand the use of clean diesel vehicles and biodiesel fuel. (applause.) we must continue investing in new methods of producing ethanol — (applause) — using everything from wood chips to grasses, to agricultural wastes. we made a lot of progress, thanks to good policies here in washington and the strong response of the market. and now even more dramatic advances are within reach. tonight, i ask congress to join me in pursuing a great goal. let us build on the work we\\'ve done and reduce gasoline usage in the united states by 20 percent in the next 10 years. (applause.) when we do that we will have cut our total imports by the equivalent of three-quarters of all the oil we now import from the middle east. to reach this goal, we must increase the supply of alternative fuels, by setting a mandatory fuels standard to require 35 billion gallons of renewable and alternative fuels in 2017 — and that is nearly five times the current target. (applause.) at the same time, we need to reform and modernize fuel economy standards for cars the way we did for light trucks — and conserve up to 8.5 billion more gallons of gasoline by 2017. achieving these ambitious goals will dramatically reduce our dependence on foreign oil, but it\\'s not going to eliminate it. and so as we continue to diversify our fuel supply, we must step up domestic oil production in environmentally sensitive ways. (applause.) and to further protect america against severe disruptions to our oil supply, i ask congress to double the current capacity of the strategic petroleum reserve. (applause.) america is on the verge of technological breakthroughs that will enable us to live our lives less dependent on oil. and these technologies will help us be better stewards of the environment, and they will help us to confront the serious challenge of global climate change. (applause.) a future of hope and opportunity requires a fair, impartial system of justice. the lives of our citizens across our nation are affected by the outcome of cases pending in our federal courts. we have a shared obligation to ensure that the federal courts have enough judges to hear those cases and deliver timely rulings. as president, i have a duty to nominate qualified men and women to vacancies on the federal bench. and the united states senate has a duty, as well, to give those nominees a fair hearing, and a prompt up-or-down vote on the senate floor. (applause.) for all of us in this room, there is no higher responsibility than to protect the people of this country from danger. five years have come and gone since we saw the scenes and felt the sorrow that the terrorists can cause. we\\'ve had time to take stock of our situation. we\\'ve added many critical protections to guard the homeland. we know with certainty that the horrors of that september morning were just a glimpse of what the terrorists intend for us — unless we stop them. with the distance of time, we find ourselves debating the causes of conflict and the course we have followed. such debates are essential when a great democracy faces great questions. yet one question has surely been settled: that to win the war on terror we must take the fight to the enemy. (applause.) from the start, america and our allies have protected our people by staying on the offense. the enemy knows that the days of comfortable sanctuary, easy movement, steady financing, and free flowing communications are long over. for the terrorists, life since 9/11 has never been the same. our success in this war is often measured by the things that did not happen. we cannot know the full extent of the attacks that we and our allies have prevented, but here is some of what we do know: we stopped an al qaeda plot to fly a hijacked airplane into the tallest building on the west coast. we broke up a southeast asian terror cell grooming operatives for attacks inside the united states. we uncovered an al qaeda cell developing anthrax to be used in attacks against america. and just last august, british authorities uncovered a plot to blow up passenger planes bound for america over the atlantic ocean. for each life saved, we owe a debt of gratitude to the brave public servants who devote their lives to finding the terrorists and stopping them. (applause.) every success against the terrorists is a reminder of the shoreless ambitions of this enemy. the evil that inspired and rejoiced in 9/11 is still at work in the world. and so long as that\\'s the case, america is still a nation at war. in the mind of the terrorist, this war began well before september the 11th, and will not end until their radical vision is fulfilled. and these past five years have given us a much clearer view of the nature of this enemy. al qaeda and its followers are sunni extremists, possessed by hatred and commanded by a harsh and narrow ideology. take almost any principle of civilization, and their goal is the opposite. they preach with threats, instruct with bullets and bombs, and promise paradise for the murder of the innocent. our enemies are quite explicit about their intentions. they want to overthrow moderate governments, and establish safe havens from which to plan and carry out new attacks on our country. by killing and terrorizing americans, they want to force our country to retreat from the world and abandon the cause of liberty. they would then be free to impose their will and spread their totalitarian ideology. listen to this warning from the late terrorist zarqawi: \"we will sacrifice our blood and bodies to put an end to your dreams, and what is coming is even worse.\" osama bin laden declared: \"death is better than living on this earth with the unbelievers among us.\" these men are not given to idle words, and they are just one camp in the islamist radical movement. in recent times, it has also become clear that we face an escalating danger from shia extremists who are just as hostile to america, and are also determined to dominate the middle east. many are known to take direction from the regime in iran, which is funding and arming terrorists like hezbollah — a group second only to al qaeda in the american lives it has taken. the shia and sunni extremists are different faces of the same totalitarian threat. whatever slogans they chant, when they slaughter the innocent they have the same wicked purposes. they want to kill americans, kill democracy in the middle east, and gain the weapons to kill on an even more horrific scale. in the sixth year since our nation was attacked, i wish i could report to you that the dangers had ended. they have not. and so it remains the policy of this government to use every lawful and proper tool of intelligence, diplomacy, law enforcement, and military action to do our duty, to find these enemies, and to protect the american people. (applause.) this war is more than a clash of arms — it is a decisive ideological struggle, and the security of our nation is in the balance. to prevail, we must remove the conditions that inspire blind hatred, and drove 19 men to get onto airplanes and to come and kill us. what every terrorist fears most is human freedom — societies where men and women make their own choices, answer to their own conscience, and live by their hopes instead of their resentments. free people are not drawn to violent and malignant ideologies — and most will choose a better way when they\\'re given a chance. so we advance our own security interests by helping moderates and reformers and brave voices for democracy. the great question of our day is whether america will help men and women in the middle east to build free societies and share in the rights of all humanity. and i say, for the sake of our own security, we must. (applause.) in the last two years, we\\'ve seen the desire for liberty in the broader middle east — and we have been sobered by the enemy\\'s fierce reaction. in 2005, the world watched as the citizens of lebanon raised the banner of the cedar revolution, they drove out the syrian occupiers and chose new leaders in free elections. in 2005, the people of afghanistan defied the terrorists and elected a democratic legislature. and in 2005, the iraqi people held three national elections, choosing a transitional government, adopting the most progressive, democratic constitution in the arab world, and then electing a government under that constitution. despite endless threats from the killers in their midst, nearly 12 million iraqi citizens came out to vote in a show of hope and solidarity that we should never forget. (applause.) a thinking enemy watched all of these scenes, adjusted their tactics, and in 2006 they struck back. in lebanon, assassins took the life of pierre gemayel, a prominent participant in the cedar revolution. hezbollah terrorists, with support from syria and iran, sowed conflict in the region and are seeking to undermine lebanon\\'s legitimately elected government. in afghanistan, taliban and al qaeda fighters tried to regain power by regrouping and engaging afghan and nato forces. in iraq, al qaeda and other sunni extremists blew up one of the most sacred places in shia islam — the golden mosque of samarra. this atrocity, directed at a muslim house of prayer, was designed to provoke retaliation from iraqi shia — and it succeeded. radical shia elements, some of whom receive support from iran, formed death squads. the result was a tragic escalation of sectarian rage and reprisal that continues to this day. this is not the fight we entered in iraq, but it is the fight we\\'re in. every one of us wishes this war were over and won. yet it would not be like us to leave our promises unkept, our friends abandoned, and our own security at risk. (applause.) ladies and gentlemen: on this day, at this hour, it is still within our power to shape the outcome of this battle. let us find our resolve, and turn events toward victory. (applause.) we\\'re carrying out a new strategy in iraq — a plan that demands more from iraq\\'s elected government, and gives our forces in iraq the reinforcements they need to complete their mission. our goal is a democratic iraq that upholds the rule of law, respects the rights of its people, provides them security, and is an ally in the war on terror. in order to make progress toward this goal, the iraqi government must stop the sectarian violence in its capital. but the iraqis are not yet ready to do this on their own. so we\\'re deploying reinforcements of more than 20,000 additional soldiers and marines to iraq. the vast majority will go to baghdad, where they will help iraqi forces to clear and secure neighborhoods, and serve as advisers embedded in iraqi army units. with iraqis in the lead, our forces will help secure the city by chasing down the terrorists, insurgents, and the roaming death squads. and in anbar province, where al qaeda terrorists have gathered and local forces have begun showing a willingness to fight them, we\\'re sending an additional 4,000 united states marines, with orders to find the terrorists and clear them out. (applause.) we didn\\'t drive al qaeda out of their safe haven in afghanistan only to let them set up a new safe haven in a free iraq. the people of iraq want to live in peace, and now it\\'s time for their government to act. iraq\\'s leaders know that our commitment is not open-ended. they have promised to deploy more of their own troops to secure baghdad — and they must do so. they pledged that they will confront violent radicals of any faction or political party — and they need to follow through, and lift needless restrictions on iraqi and coalition forces, so these troops can achieve their mission of bringing security to all of the people of baghdad. iraq\\'s leaders have committed themselves to a series of benchmarks — to achieve reconciliation, to share oil revenues among all of iraq\\'s citizens, to put the wealth of iraq into the rebuilding of iraq, to allow more iraqis to re-enter their nation\\'s civic life, to hold local elections, and to take responsibility for security in every iraqi province. but for all of this to happen, baghdad must be secure. and our plan will help the iraqi government take back its capital and make good on its commitments. my fellow citizens, our military commanders and i have carefully weighed the options. we discussed every possible approach. in the end, i chose this course of action because it provides the best chance for success. many in this chamber understand that america must not fail in iraq, because you understand that the consequences of failure would be grievous and far-reaching. if american forces step back before baghdad is secure, the iraqi government would be overrun by extremists on all sides. we could expect an epic battle between shia extremists backed by iran, and sunni extremists aided by al qaeda and supporters of the old regime. a contagion of violence could spill out across the country — and in time, the entire region could be drawn into the conflict. for america, this is a nightmare scenario. for the enemy, this is the objective. chaos is the greatest ally — their greatest ally in this struggle. and out of chaos in iraq would emerge an emboldened enemy with new safe havens, new recruits, new resources, and an even greater determination to harm america. to allow this to happen would be to ignore the lessons of september the 11th and invite tragedy. ladies and gentlemen, nothing is more important at this moment in our history than for america to succeed in the middle east, to succeed in iraq and to spare the american people from this danger. (applause.) this is where matters stand tonight, in the here and now. i have spoken with many of you in person. i respect you and the arguments you\\'ve made. we went into this largely united, in our assumptions and in our convictions. and whatever you voted for, you did not vote for failure. our country is pursuing a new strategy in iraq, and i ask you to give it a chance to work. and i ask you to support our troops in the field, and those on their way. (applause.) the war on terror we fight today is a generational struggle that will continue long after you and i have turned our duties over to others. and that\\'s why it\\'s important to work together so our nation can see this great effort through. both parties and both branches should work in close consultation. it\\'s why i propose to establish a special advisory council on the war on terror, made up of leaders in congress from both political parties. we will share ideas for how to position america to meet every challenge that confronts us. we\\'ll show our enemies abroad that we are united in the goal of victory. and one of the first steps we can take together is to add to the ranks of our military so that the american armed forces are ready for all the challenges ahead. (applause.) tonight i ask the congress to authorize an increase in the size of our active army and marine corps by 92,000 in the next five years. (applause.) a second task we can take on together is to design and establish a volunteer civilian reserve corps. such a corps would function much like our military reserve. it would ease the burden on the armed forces by allowing us to hire civilians with critical skills to serve on missions abroad when america needs them. it would give people across america who do not wear the uniform a chance to serve in the defining struggle of our time. americans can have confidence in the outcome of this struggle because we\\'re not in this struggle alone. we have a diplomatic strategy that is rallying the world to join in the fight against extremism. in iraq, multinational forces are operating under a mandate from the united nations. we\\'re working with jordan and saudi arabia and egypt and the gulf states to increase support for iraq\\'s government. the united nations has imposed sanctions on iran, and made it clear that the world will not allow the regime in tehran to acquire nuclear weapons. (applause.) with the other members of the quartet — the u.n., the european union, and russia — we\\'re pursuing diplomacy to help bring peace to the holy land, and pursuing the establishment of a democratic palestinian state living side-by-side with israel in peace and security. (applause.) in afghanistan, nato has taken the lead in turning back the taliban and al qaeda offensive — the first time the alliance has deployed forces outside the north atlantic area. together with our partners in china, japan, russia, and south korea, we\\'re pursuing intensive diplomacy to achieve a korean peninsula free of nuclear weapons. (applause.) we will continue to speak out for the cause of freedom in places like cuba, belarus, and burma [1] — and continue to awaken the conscience of the world to save the people of darfur. (applause.) american foreign policy is more than a matter of war and diplomacy. our work in the world is also based on a timeless truth: to whom much is given, much is required. we hear the call to take on the challenges of hunger and poverty and disease — and that is precisely what america is doing. we must continue to fight hiv/aids, especially on the continent of africa. (applause.) because you funded our emergency plan for aids relief, the number of people receiving life-saving drugs has grown from 50,000 to more than 800,000 in three short years. i ask you to continue funding our efforts to fight hiv/aids. i ask you to provide $1.2 billion over five years so we can combat malaria in 15 african countries. (applause.) i ask that you fund the millennium challenge account, so that american aid reaches the people who need it, in nations where democracy is on the rise and corruption is in retreat. and let us continue to support the expanded trade and debt relief that are the best hope for lifting lives and eliminating poverty. (applause.) when america serves others in this way, we show the strength and generosity of our country. these deeds reflect the character of our people. the greatest strength we have is the heroic kindness, courage, and self-sacrifice of the american people. you see this spirit often if you know where to look — and tonight we need only look above to the gallery. dikembe mutombo grew up in africa, amid great poverty and disease. he came to georgetown university on a scholarship to study medicine — but coach john thompson got a look at dikembe and had a different idea. (laughter.) dikembe became a star in the nba, and a citizen of the united states. but he never forgot the land of his birth, or the duty to share his blessings with others. he built a brand new hospital in his old hometown. a friend has said of this good-hearted man: \"mutombo believes that god has given him this opportunity to do great things.\" and we are proud to call this son of the congo [2] a citizen of the united states of america. (applause.) after her daughter was born, julie aigner-clark searched for ways to share her love of music and art with her child. so she borrowed some equipment, and began filming children\\'s videos in her basement. the baby einstein company was born, and in just five years her business grew to more than $20 million in sales. in november 2001, julie sold baby einstein to the walt disney company, and with her help baby einstein has grown into a $200 million business. julie represents the great enterprising spirit of america. and she is using her success to help others — producing child safety videos with john walsh of the national center for missing and exploited children. julie says of her new project: \"i believe it\\'s the most important thing that i have ever done. i believe that children have the right to live in a world that is safe.\" and so tonight, we are pleased to welcome this talented business entrepreneur and generous social entrepreneur — julie aigner-clark. (applause.) three weeks ago, wesley autrey was waiting at a harlem subway station with his two little girls, when he saw a man fall into the path of a train. with seconds to act, wesley jumped onto the tracks, pulled the man into the space between the rails, and held him as the train passed right above their heads. he insists he\\'s not a hero. he says: \"we got guys and girls overseas dying for us to have our freedoms. we have got to show each other some love.\" there is something wonderful about a country that produces a brave and humble man like wesley autrey. (applause.) tommy rieman was a teenager pumping gas in independence, kentucky, when he enlisted in the united states army. in december 2003, he was on a reconnaissance mission in iraq when his team came under heavy enemy fire. from his humvee, sergeant rieman returned fire; he used his body as a shield to protect his gunner. he was shot in the chest and arm, and received shrapnel wounds to his legs — yet he refused medical attention, and stayed in the fight. he helped to repel a second attack, firing grenades at the enemy\\'s position. for his exceptional courage, sergeant rieman was awarded the silver star. and like so many other americans who have volunteered to defend us, he has earned the respect and the gratitude of our entire country. (applause.) in such courage and compassion, ladies and gentlemen, we see the spirit and character of america — and these qualities are not in short supply. this is a decent and honorable country — and resilient, too. we\\'ve been through a lot together. we\\'ve met challenges and faced dangers, and we know that more lie ahead. yet we can go forward with confidence — because the state of our union is strong, our cause in the world is right, and tonight that cause goes on. god bless. (applause.) see you next year. thank you for your prayers.'\n",
      " 'the president: madam speaker, vice president cheney, members of congress, distinguished guests, and fellow citizens: seven years have passed since i first stood before you at this rostrum. in that time, our country has been tested in ways none of us could have imagined. we faced hard decisions about peace and war, rising competition in the world economy, and the health and welfare of our citizens. these issues call for vigorous debate, and i think it\\'s fair to say we\\'ve answered the call. yet history will record that amid our differences, we acted with purpose. and together, we showed the world the power and resilience of american self-government.all of us were sent to washington to carry out the people\\'s business. that is the purpose of this body. it is the meaning of our oath. it remains our charge to keep.the actions of the 110th congress will affect the security and prosperity of our nation long after this session has ended. in this election year, let us show our fellow americans that we recognize our responsibilities and are determined to meet them. let us show them that republicans and democrats can compete for votes and cooperate for results at the same time. (applause.)from expanding opportunity to protecting our country, we\\'ve made good progress. yet we have unfinished business before us, and the american people expect us to get it done.in the work ahead, we must be guided by the philosophy that made our nation great. as americans, we believe in the power of individuals to determine their destiny and shape the course of history. we believe that the most reliable guide for our country is the collective wisdom of ordinary citizens. and so in all we do, we must trust in the ability of free peoples to make wise decisions, and empower them to improve their lives for their futures.to build a prosperous future, we must trust people with their own money and empower them to grow our economy. as we meet tonight, our economy is undergoing a period of uncertainty. america has added jobs for a record 52 straight months, but jobs are now growing at a slower pace. wages are up, but so are prices for food and gas. exports are rising, but the housing market has declined. at kitchen tables across our country, there is a concern about our economic future.in the long run, americans can be confident about our economic growth. but in the short run, we can all see that that growth is slowing. so last week, my administration reached agreement with speaker pelosi and republican leader boehner on a robust growth package that includes tax relief for individuals and families and incentives for business investment. the temptation will be to load up the bill. that would delay it or derail it, and neither option is acceptable. (applause.) this is a good agreement that will keep our economy growing and our people working. and this congress must pass it as soon as possible. (applause.)we have other work to do on taxes. unless congress acts, most of the tax relief we\\'ve delivered over the past seven years will be taken away. some in washington argue that letting tax relief expire is not a tax increase. try explaining that to 116 million american taxpayers who would see their taxes rise by an average of $1,800. others have said they would personally be happy to pay higher taxes. i welcome their enthusiasm. i\\'m pleased to report that the irs accepts both checks and money orders. (laughter and applause.)most americans think their taxes are high enough. with all the other pressures on their finances, american families should not have to worry about their federal government taking a bigger bite out of their paychecks. there\\'s only one way to eliminate this uncertainty: make the tax relief permanent. (applause.) and members of congress should know: if any bill raises taxes reaches my desk, i will veto it. (applause.)just as we trust americans with their own money, we need to earn their trust by spending their tax dollars wisely. next week, i\\'ll send you a budget that terminates or substantially reduces 151 wasteful or bloated programs, totaling more than $18 billion. the budget that i will submit will keep america on track for a surplus in 2012. american families have to balance their budgets; so should their government. (applause.)the people\\'s trust in their government is undermined by congressional earmarks — special interest projects that are often snuck in at the last minute, without discussion or debate. last year, i asked you to voluntarily cut the number and cost of earmarks in half. i also asked you to stop slipping earmarks into committee reports that never even come to a vote. unfortunately, neither goal was met. so this time, if you send me an appropriations bill that does not cut the number and cost of earmarks in half, i\\'ll send it back to you with my veto. (applause.)and tomorrow, i will issue an executive order that directs federal agencies to ignore any future earmark that is not voted on by congress. if these items are truly worth funding, congress should debate them in the open and hold a public vote. (applause.)our shared responsibilities extend beyond matters of taxes and spending. on housing, we must trust americans with the responsibility of homeownership and empower them to weather turbulent times in the housing market. my administration brought together the hope now alliance, which is helping many struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure. and congress can help even more. tonight i ask you to pass legislation to reform fannie mae and freddie mac, modernize the federal housing administration, and allow state housing agencies to issue tax-free bonds to help homeowners refinance their mortgages. (applause.) these are difficult times for many american families, and by taking these steps, we can help more of them keep their homes.to build a future of quality health care, we must trust patients and doctors to make medical decisions and empower them with better information and better options. we share a common goal: making health care more affordable and accessible for all americans. (applause.) the best way to achieve that goal is by expanding consumer choice, not government control. (applause.) so i have proposed ending the bias in the tax code against those who do not get their health insurance through their employer. this one reform would put private coverage within reach for millions, and i call on the congress to pass it this year. (applause.)the congress must also expand health savings accounts, create association health plans for small businesses, promote health information technology, and confront the epidemic of junk medical lawsuits. (applause.) with all these steps, we will help ensure that decisions about your medical care are made in the privacy of your doctor\\'s office — not in the halls of congress. (applause.)on education, we must trust students to learn if given the chance, and empower parents to demand results from our schools. in neighborhoods across our country, there are boys and girls with dreams — and a decent education is their only hope of achieving them.six years ago, we came together to pass the no child left behind act, and today no one can deny its results. last year, fourth and eighth graders achieved the highest math scores on record. reading scores are on the rise. african american and hispanic students posted all-time highs. (applause.) now we must work together to increase accountability, add flexibility for states and districts, reduce the number of high school dropouts, provide extra help for struggling schools.members of congress: the no child left behind act is a bipartisan achievement. it is succeeding. and we owe it to america\\'s children, their parents, and their teachers to strengthen this good law. (applause.)we must also do more to help children when their schools do not measure up. thanks to the d.c. opportunity scholarships you approved, more than 2,600 of the poorest children in our nation\\'s capital have found new hope at a faith-based or other non-public school. sadly, these schools are disappearing at an alarming rate in many of america\\'s inner cities. so i will convene a white house summit aimed at strengthening these lifelines of learning. and to open the doors of these schools to more children, i ask you to support a new $300 million program called pell grants for kids. we have seen how pell grants help low-income college students realize their full potential. together, we\\'ve expanded the size and reach of these grants. now let us apply that same spirit to help liberate poor children trapped in failing public schools. (applause.)on trade, we must trust american workers to compete with anyone in the world and empower them by opening up new markets overseas. today, our economic growth increasingly depends on our ability to sell american goods and crops and services all over the world. so we\\'re working to break down barriers to trade and investment wherever we can. we\\'re working for a successful doha round of trade talks, and we must complete a good agreement this year. at the same time, we\\'re pursuing opportunities to open up new markets by passing free trade agreements.i thank the congress for approving a good agreement with peru. and now i ask you to approve agreements with colombia and panama and south korea. (applause.) many products from these nations now enter america duty-free, yet many of our products face steep tariffs in their markets. these agreements will level the playing field. they will give us better access to nearly 100 million customers. they will support good jobs for the finest workers in the world: those whose products say \"made in the usa.\" (applause.)these agreements also promote america\\'s strategic interests. the first agreement that will come before you is with colombia, a friend of america that is confronting violence and terror, and fighting drug traffickers. if we fail to pass this agreement, we will embolden the purveyors of false populism in our hemisphere. so we must come together, pass this agreement, and show our neighbors in the region that democracy leads to a better life. (applause.)trade brings better jobs and better choices and better prices. yet for some americans, trade can mean losing a job, and the federal government has a responsibility to help. (applause.) i ask congress to reauthorize and reform trade adjustment assistance, so we can help these displaced workers learn new skills and find new jobs. (applause.)to build a future of energy security, we must trust in the creative genius of american researchers and entrepreneurs and empower them to pioneer a new generation of clean energy technology. (applause.) our security, our prosperity, and our environment all require reducing our dependence on oil. last year, i asked you to pass legislation to reduce oil consumption over the next decade, and you responded. together we should take the next steps: let us fund new technologies that can generate coal power while capturing carbon emissions. (applause.) let us increase the use of renewable power and emissions-free nuclear power. (applause.) let us continue investing in advanced battery technology and renewable fuels to power the cars and trucks of the future. (applause.) let us create a new international clean technology fund, which will help developing nations like india and china make greater use of clean energy sources. and let us complete an international agreement that has the potential to slow, stop, and eventually reverse the growth of greenhouse gases. (applause.)this agreement will be effective only if it includes commitments by every major economy and gives none a free ride. (applause.) the united states is committed to strengthening our energy security and confronting global climate change. and the best way to meet these goals is for america to continue leading the way toward the development of cleaner and more energy-efficient technology. (applause.)to keep america competitive into the future, we must trust in the skill of our scientists and engineers and empower them to pursue the breakthroughs of tomorrow. last year, congress passed legislation supporting the american competitiveness initiative, but never followed through with the funding. this funding is essential to keeping our scientific edge. so i ask congress to double federal support for critical basic research in the physical sciences and ensure america remains the most dynamic nation on earth. (applause.)on matters of life and science, we must trust in the innovative spirit of medical researchers and empower them to discover new treatments while respecting moral boundaries. in november, we witnessed a landmark achievement when scientists discovered a way to reprogram adult skin cells to act like embryonic stem cells. this breakthrough has the potential to move us beyond the divisive debates of the past by extending the frontiers of medicine without the destruction of human life. (applause.)so we\\'re expanding funding for this type of ethical medical research. and as we explore promising avenues of research, we must also ensure that all life is treated with the dignity it deserves. and so i call on congress to pass legislation that bans unethical practices such as the buying, selling, patenting, or cloning of human life. (applause.)on matters of justice, we must trust in the wisdom of our founders and empower judges who understand that the constitution means what it says. (applause.) i\\'ve submitted judicial nominees who will rule by the letter of the law, not the whim of the gavel. many of these nominees are being unfairly delayed. they are worthy of confirmation, and the senate should give each of them a prompt up-or-down vote. (applause.)in communities across our land, we must trust in the good heart of the american people and empower them to serve their neighbors in need. over the past seven years, more of our fellow citizens have discovered that the pursuit of happiness leads to the path of service. americans have volunteered in record numbers. charitable donations are higher than ever. faith-based groups are bringing hope to pockets of despair, with newfound support from the federal government. and to help guarantee equal treatment of faith-based organizations when they compete for federal funds, i ask you to permanently extend charitable choice. (applause.)tonight the armies of compassion continue the march to a new day in the gulf coast. america honors the strength and resilience of the people of this region. we reaffirm our pledge to help them build stronger and better than before. and tonight i\\'m pleased to announce that in april we will host this year\\'s north american summit of canada, mexico, and the united states in the great city of new orleans. (applause.)there are two other pressing challenges that i\\'ve raised repeatedly before this body, and that this body has failed to address: entitlement spending and immigration. every member in this chamber knows that spending on entitlement programs like social security, medicare, and medicaid is growing faster than we can afford. we all know the painful choices ahead if america stays on this path: massive tax increases, sudden and drastic cuts in benefits, or crippling deficits. i\\'ve laid out proposals to reform these programs. now i ask members of congress to offer your proposals and come up with a bipartisan solution to save these vital programs for our children and our grandchildren. (applause.)the other pressing challenge is immigration. america needs to secure our borders — and with your help, my administration is taking steps to do so. we\\'re increasing worksite enforcement, deploying fences and advanced technologies to stop illegal crossings. we\\'ve effectively ended the policy of \"catch and release\" at the border, and by the end of this year, we will have doubled the number of border patrol agents. yet we also need to acknowledge that we will never fully secure our border until we create a lawful way for foreign workers to come here and support our economy. (applause.) this will take pressure off the border and allow law enforcement to concentrate on those who mean us harm. we must also find a sensible and humane way to deal with people here illegally. illegal immigration is complicated, but it can be resolved. and it must be resolved in a way that upholds both our laws and our highest ideals. (applause.)this is the business of our nation here at home. yet building a prosperous future for our citizens also depends on confronting enemies abroad and advancing liberty in troubled regions of the world.our foreign policy is based on a clear premise: we trust that people, when given the chance, will choose a future of freedom and peace. in the last seven years, we have witnessed stirring moments in the history of liberty. we\\'ve seen citizens in georgia and ukraine stand up for their right to free and fair elections. we\\'ve seen people in lebanon take to the streets to demand their independence. we\\'ve seen afghans emerge from the tyranny of the taliban and choose a new president and a new parliament. we\\'ve seen jubilant iraqis holding up ink-stained fingers and celebrating their freedom. these images of liberty have inspired us. (applause.)in the past seven years, we\\'ve also seen images that have sobered us. we\\'ve watched throngs of mourners in lebanon and pakistan carrying the caskets of beloved leaders taken by the assassin\\'s hand. we\\'ve seen wedding guests in blood-soaked finery staggering from a hotel in jordan, afghans and iraqis blown up in mosques and markets, and trains in london and madrid ripped apart by bombs. on a clear september day, we saw thousands of our fellow citizens taken from us in an instant. these horrific images serve as a grim reminder: the advance of liberty is opposed by terrorists and extremists — evil men who despise freedom, despise america, and aim to subject millions to their violent rule.since 9/11, we have taken the fight to these terrorists and extremists. we will stay on the offense, we will keep up the pressure, and we will deliver justice to our enemies. (applause.)we are engaged in the defining ideological struggle of the 21st century. the terrorists oppose every principle of humanity and decency that we hold dear. yet in this war on terror, there is one thing we and our enemies agree on: in the long run, men and women who are free to determine their own destinies will reject terror and refuse to live in tyranny. and that is why the terrorists are fighting to deny this choice to the people in lebanon, iraq, afghanistan, pakistan, and the palestinian territories. and that is why, for the security of america and the peace of the world, we are spreading the hope of freedom. (applause.)in afghanistan, america, our 25 nato allies, and 15 partner nations are helping the afghan people defend their freedom and rebuild their country. thanks to the courage of these military and civilian personnel, a nation that was once a safe haven for al qaeda is now a young democracy where boys and girls are going to school, new roads and hospitals are being built, and people are looking to the future with new hope. these successes must continue, so we\\'re adding 3,200 marines to our forces in afghanistan, where they will fight the terrorists and train the afghan army and police. defeating the taliban and al qaeda is critical to our security, and i thank the congress for supporting america\\'s vital mission in afghanistan. (applause.)in iraq, the terrorists and extremists are fighting to deny a proud people their liberty, and fighting to establish safe havens for attacks across the world. one year ago, our enemies were succeeding in their efforts to plunge iraq into chaos. so we reviewed our strategy and changed course. we launched a surge of american forces into iraq. we gave our troops a new mission: work with the iraqi forces to protect the iraqi people, pursue the enemy in its strongholds, and deny the terrorists sanctuary anywhere in the country.the iraqi people quickly realized that something dramatic had happened. those who had worried that america was preparing to abandon them instead saw tens of thousands of american forces flowing into their country. they saw our forces moving into neighborhoods, clearing out the terrorists, and staying behind to ensure the enemy did not return. and they saw our troops, along with provincial reconstruction teams that include foreign service officers and other skilled public servants, coming in to ensure that improved security was followed by improvements in daily life. our military and civilians in iraq are performing with courage and distinction, and they have the gratitude of our whole nation. (applause.)the iraqis launched a surge of their own. in the fall of 2006, sunni tribal leaders grew tired of al qaeda\\'s brutality and started a popular uprising called \"the anbar awakening.\" over the past year, similar movements have spread across the country. and today, the grassroots surge includes more than 80,000 iraqi citizens who are fighting the terrorists. the government in baghdad has stepped forward, as well — adding more than 100,000 new iraqi soldiers and police during the past year.while the enemy is still dangerous and more work remains, the american and iraqi surges have achieved results few of us could have imagined just one year ago. (applause.) when we met last year, many said that containing the violence was impossible. a year later, high profile terrorist attacks are down, civilian deaths are down, sectarian killings are down.when we met last year, militia extremists — some armed and trained by iran — were wreaking havoc in large areas of iraq. a year later, coalition and iraqi forces have killed or captured hundreds of militia fighters. and iraqis of all backgrounds increasingly realize that defeating these militia fighters is critical to the future of their country.when we met last year, al qaeda had sanctuaries in many areas of iraq, and their leaders had just offered american forces safe passage out of the country. today, it is al qaeda that is searching for safe passage. they have been driven from many of the strongholds they once held, and over the past year, we\\'ve captured or killed thousands of extremists in iraq, including hundreds of key al qaeda leaders and operatives.last month, osama bin laden released a tape in which he railed against iraqi tribal leaders who have turned on al qaeda and admitted that coalition forces are growing stronger in iraq. ladies and gentlemen, some may deny the surge is working, but among the terrorists there is no doubt. al qaeda is on the run in iraq, and this enemy will be defeated. (applause.)when we met last year, our troop levels in iraq were on the rise. today, because of the progress just described, we are implementing a policy of \"return on success,\" and the surge forces we sent to iraq are beginning to come home.this progress is a credit to the valor of our troops and the brilliance of their commanders. this evening, i want to speak directly to our men and women on the front lines. soldiers and sailors, airmen, marines, and coast guardsmen: in the past year, you have done everything we\\'ve asked of you, and more. our nation is grateful for your courage. we are proud of your accomplishments. and tonight in this hallowed chamber, with the american people as our witness, we make you a solemn pledge: in the fight ahead, you will have all you need to protect our nation. (applause.) and i ask congress to meet its responsibilities to these brave men and women by fully funding our troops. (applause.)our enemies in iraq have been hit hard. they are not yet defeated, and we can still expect tough fighting ahead. our objective in the coming year is to sustain and build on the gains we made in 2007, while transitioning to the next phase of our strategy. american troops are shifting from leading operations, to partnering with iraqi forces, and, eventually, to a protective overwatch mission. as part of this transition, one army brigade combat team and one marine expeditionary unit have already come home and will not be replaced. in the coming months, four additional brigades and two marine battalions will follow suit. taken together, this means more than 20,000 of our troops are coming home. (applause.)any further drawdown of u.s. troops will be based on conditions in iraq and the recommendations of our commanders. general petraeus has warned that too fast a drawdown could result in the \"disintegration of the iraqi security forces, al qaeda-iraq regaining lost ground, [and] a marked increase in violence.\" members of congress: having come so far and achieved so much, we must not allow this to happen. (applause.)in the coming year, we will work with iraqi leaders as they build on the progress they\\'re making toward political reconciliation. at the local level, sunnis, shia, and kurds are beginning to come together to reclaim their communities and rebuild their lives. progress in the provinces must be matched by progress in baghdad. (applause.) we\\'re seeing some encouraging signs. the national government is sharing oil revenues with the provinces. the parliament recently passed both a pension law and de-baathification reform. they\\'re now debating a provincial powers law. the iraqis still have a distance to travel. but after decades of dictatorship and the pain of sectarian violence, reconciliation is taking place — and the iraqi people are taking control of their future. (applause.)the mission in iraq has been difficult and trying for our nation. but it is in the vital interest of the united states that we succeed. a free iraq will deny al qaeda a safe haven. a free iraq will show millions across the middle east that a future of liberty is possible. a free iraq will be a friend of america, a partner in fighting terror, and a source of stability in a dangerous part of the world.by contrast, a failed iraq would embolden the extremists, strengthen iran, and give terrorists a base from which to launch new attacks on our friends, our allies, and our homeland. the enemy has made its intentions clear. at a time when the momentum seemed to favor them, al qaida\\'s top commander in iraq declared that they will not rest until they have attacked us here in washington. my fellow americans: we will not rest either. we will not rest until this enemy has been defeated. (applause.) we must do the difficult work today, so that years from now people will look back and say that this generation rose to the moment, prevailed in a tough fight, and left behind a more hopeful region and a safer america. (applause.)we\\'re also standing against the forces of extremism in the holy land, where we have new cause for hope. palestinians have elected a president who recognizes that confronting terror is essential to achieving a state where his people can live in dignity and at peace with israel. israelis have leaders who recognize that a peaceful, democratic palestinian state will be a source of lasting security. this month in ramallah and jerusalem, i assured leaders from both sides that america will do, and i will do, everything we can to help them achieve a peace agreement that defines a palestinian state by the end of this year. the time has come for a holy land where a democratic israel and a democratic palestine live side-by-side in peace. (applause.)we\\'re also standing against the forces of extremism embodied by the regime in tehran. iran\\'s rulers oppress a good and talented people. and wherever freedom advances in the middle east, it seems the iranian regime is there to oppose it. iran is funding and training militia groups in iraq, supporting hezbollah terrorists in lebanon, and backing hamas\\' efforts to undermine peace in the holy land. tehran is also developing ballistic missiles of increasing range, and continues to develop its capability to enrich uranium, which could be used to create a nuclear weapon.our message to the people of iran is clear: we have no quarrel with you. we respect your traditions and your history. we look forward to the day when you have your freedom. our message to the leaders of iran is also clear: verifiably suspend your nuclear enrichment, so negotiations can begin. and to rejoin the community of nations, come clean about your nuclear intentions and past actions, stop your oppression at home, cease your support for terror abroad. but above all, know this: america will confront those who threaten our troops. we will stand by our allies, and we will defend our vital interests in the persian gulf. (applause.)on the home front, we will continue to take every lawful and effective measure to protect our country. this is our most solemn duty. we are grateful that there has not been another attack on our soil since 9/11. this is not for the lack of desire or effort on the part of the enemy. in the past six years, we\\'ve stopped numerous attacks, including a plot to fly a plane into the tallest building in los angeles and another to blow up passenger jets bound for america over the atlantic. dedicated men and women in our government toil day and night to stop the terrorists from carrying out their plans. these good citizens are saving american lives, and everyone in this chamber owes them our thanks. (applause.)and we owe them something more: we owe them the tools they need to keep our people safe. and one of the most important tools we can give them is the ability to monitor terrorist communications. to protect america, we need to know who the terrorists are talking to, what they are saying, and what they\\'re planning. last year, congress passed legislation to help us do that. unfortunately, congress set the legislation to expire on february the 1st. that means if you don\\'t act by friday, our ability to track terrorist threats would be weakened and our citizens will be in greater danger. congress must ensure the flow of vital intelligence is not disrupted. congress must pass liability protection for companies believed to have assisted in the efforts to defend america. we\\'ve had ample time for debate. the time to act is now. (applause.)protecting our nation from the dangers of a new century requires more than good intelligence and a strong military. it also requires changing the conditions that breed resentment and allow extremists to prey on despair. so america is using its influence to build a freer, more hopeful, and more compassionate world. this is a reflection of our national interest; it is the calling of our conscience.america opposes genocide in sudan. (applause.) we support freedom in countries from cuba and zimbabwe to belarus and burma. (applause.)america is leading the fight against global poverty, with strong education initiatives and humanitarian assistance. we\\'ve also changed the way we deliver aid by launching the millennium challenge account. this program strengthens democracy, transparency, and the rule of law in developing nations, and i ask you to fully fund this important initiative. (applause.)america is leading the fight against global hunger. today, more than half the world\\'s food aid comes from the united states. and tonight, i ask congress to support an innovative proposal to provide food assistance by purchasing crops directly from farmers in the developing world, so we can build up local agriculture and help break the cycle of famine. (applause.)america is leading the fight against disease. with your help, we\\'re working to cut by half the number of malaria-related deaths in 15 african nations. and our emergency plan for aids relief is treating 1.4 million people. we can bring healing and hope to many more. so i ask you to maintain the principles that have changed behavior and made this program a success. and i call on you to double our initial commitment to fighting hiv/aids by approving an additional $30 billion over the next five years. (applause.)america is a force for hope in the world because we are a compassionate people, and some of the most compassionate americans are those who have stepped forward to protect us. we must keep faith with all who have risked life and limb so that we might live in freedom and peace. over the past seven years, we\\'ve increased funding for veterans by more than 95 percent. and as we increase funding — (applause.) and as increase funding we must also reform our veterans system to meet the needs of a new war and a new generation. (applause.) i call on the congress to enact the reforms recommended by senator bob dole and secretary donna shalala, so we can improve the system of care for our wounded warriors and help them build lives of hope and promise and dignity. (applause.)our military families also sacrifice for america. they endure sleepless nights and the daily struggle of providing for children while a loved one is serving far from home. we have a responsibility to provide for them. so i ask you to join me in expanding their access to child care, creating new hiring preferences for military spouses across the federal government, and allowing our troops to transfer their unused education benefits to their spouses or children. (applause.) our military families serve our nation, they inspire our nation, and tonight our nation honors them. (applause.)the strength — the secret of our strength, the miracle of america, is that our greatness lies not in our government, but in the spirit and determination of our people. (applause.) when the federal convention met in philadelphia in 1787, our nation was bound by the articles of confederation, which began with the words, \"we the undersigned delegates.\" when gouverneur morris was asked to draft a preamble to our new constitution, he offered an important revision and opened with words that changed the course of our nation and the history of the world: \"we the people.\"by trusting the people, our founders wagered that a great and noble nation could be built on the liberty that resides in the hearts of all men and women. by trusting the people, succeeding generations transformed our fragile young democracy into the most powerful nation on earth and a beacon of hope for millions. and so long as we continue to trust the people, our nation will prosper, our liberty will be secure, and the state of our union will remain strong. (applause.)so tonight, with confidence in freedom\\'s power, and trust in the people, let us set forth to do their business. god bless america. (applause.)'\n",
      " 'madame speaker, mr. vice president, members of congress, and the first lady of the united states: i\\'ve come here tonight not only to address the distinguished men and women in this great chamber, but to speak frankly and directly to the men and women who sent us here. i know that for many americans watching right now, the state of our economy is a concern that rises above all others. and rightly so. if you haven\\'t been personally affected by this recession, you probably know someone who has - a friend; a neighbor; a member of your family. you don\\'t need to hear another list of statistics to know that our economy is in crisis, because you live it every day. it\\'s the worry you wake up with and the source of sleepless nights. it\\'s the job you thought you\\'d retire from but now have lost; the business you built your dreams upon that\\'s now hanging by a thread; the college acceptance letter your child had to put back in the envelope. the impact of this recession is real, and it is everywhere. but while our economy may be weakened and our confidence shaken; though we are living through difficult and uncertain times, tonight i want every american to know this:we will rebuild, we will recover, and the united states of america willemerge stronger than before. the weight of this crisis will not determine the destiny of this nation. the answers to our problems don\\'t lie beyond our reach. they exist in our laboratories and universities; in our fields and our factories; in the imaginations of our entrepreneurs and the pride of the hardest-working people on earth. those qualities that have made america the greatest force of progress and prosperity in human history we still possess in ample measure. what is required now is for this country to pull together, confront boldly the challenges we face, and takeresponsibility for our future once more.now, if we\\'re honest with ourselves, we\\'ll admit that for too long, we have not always met these responsibilities — as a government or as a people. i say this not to lay blame or look backwards, but because it is only by understanding how we arrived at this moment that we\\'ll be able to lift ourselves out of this predicament. the fact is, our economy did not fall into decline overnight. nor did all of our problems begin when the housing market collapsed or the stock market sank. we have known for decades that our survival depends on finding new sources of energy. yet we import more oil today than ever before. the cost of health care eats up more and more of our savings each year, yet we keep delaying reform. our children will compete for jobs in a global economy that too many of our schools do not prepare them for. and though all these challenges went unsolved, we still managed to spend more money and pile up more debt, both as individuals and through our government, than ever before. in other words, we have lived through an era where too often, short-term gains were prized over long-term prosperity; where we failed to look beyond the next payment, the next quarter, or the next election. a surplus became an excuse to transfer wealth to the wealthy instead of an opportunity to invest in our future. regulations were gutted for the sake of a quick profit at the expense of a healthy market. people bought homes they knew they couldn\\'t afford from banks and lenders who pushed those bad loans anyway. and all the while, critical debates and difficult decisions were put off for some other time on some other day.well that day of reckoning has arrived, and the time to take charge of our future is here. now is the time to act boldly and wisely — to not only revive this economy, but to build a new foundation for lasting prosperity. now is the time to jumpstart job creation, re-start lending, and invest in areas like energy, health care, and education that will grow our economy, even as we make hard choices to bring our deficit down. that is what my economic agenda is designed to do, and that\\'s what i\\'d like to talk to you about tonight. it\\'s an agenda that begins with jobs. as soon as i took office, i asked this congress to send me a recovery plan by president\\'s day that would put people back to work and put money in their pockets. not because i believe in bigger government — i don\\'t. not because i\\'m not mindful of the massive debt we\\'ve inherited — i am. i called for action because the failure to do so would have cost more jobs and caused more hardships. in fact, a failure to act would have worsened our long-term deficit by assuring weak economic growth for years. that\\'s why i pushed for quick action. and tonight, i am grateful that this congress delivered, and pleased to say that the american recovery and reinvestment act is now law. over the next two years, this plan will save or create 3.5 million jobs.more than 90% of these jobs will be in the private sector — jobs rebuilding our roads and bridges; constructing wind turbines and solar panels; laying broadband and expanding mass transit.because of this plan, there are teachers who can now keep their jobs and educate our kids. health care professionals can continue caring for our sick. there are 57 police officers who are still on the streets of minneapolis tonight because this plan prevented the layoffs their department was about to make. because of this plan, 95% of the working households in america will receive a tax cut — a tax cut that you will see in your paychecks beginning on april 1st. because of this plan, families who are struggling to pay tuition costs will receive a $2,500 tax credit for all four years of college. and americans who have lost their jobs in this recession will be able to receive extended unemployment benefits and continued health care coverage to help them weather this storm. i know there are some in this chamber and watching at home who are skeptical of whether this plan will work. i understand that skepticism. here in washington, we\\'ve all seen how quickly good intentions can turn into broken promises and wasteful spending. and with a plan of this scale comes enormous responsibility to get it right. that is why i have asked vice president biden to lead a tough, unprecedented oversight effort — because nobody messes with joe. i have told each member of my cabinet as well as mayors and governors across the country that they will be held accountable by me and the american people for every dollar they spend. i have appointed a proven and aggressive inspector general to ferret out any and all cases of waste and fraud. and we have created a new website called recovery.gov so that every american can find out how and where their money is being spent. so the recovery plan we passed is the first step in getting our economy back on track. but it is just the first step. because even if we manage this plan flawlessly, there will be no real recovery unless we clean up the credit crisis that has severely weakened our financial system.i want to speak plainly and candidly about this issue tonight, because every american should know that it directly affects you and your family\\'s well-being. you should also know that the money you\\'ve deposited in banks across the country is safe; your insurance is secure; and you can rely on the continued operation of our financial system. that is not the source of concern.the concern is that if we do not re-start lending in this country, our recovery will be choked off before it even begins. you see, the flow of credit is the lifeblood of our economy. the ability to get a loan is how you finance the purchase of everything from a home to a car to a college education; how stores stock their shelves, farms buy equipment, and businesses make payroll. but credit has stopped flowing the way it should. too many bad loans from the housing crisis have made their way onto the books of too many banks. with so much debt and so little confidence, these banks are now fearful of lending out any more money to households, to businesses, or to each other. when there is no lending, families can\\'t afford to buy homes or cars. so businesses are forced to make layoffs. our economy suffers even more, and credit dries up even further. that is why this administration is moving swiftly and aggressively to break this destructive cycle, restore confidence, and re-start lending.we will do so in several ways. first, we are creating a new lending fund that represents the largest effort ever to help provide auto loans, college loans, and small business loans to the consumers and entrepreneurs who keep this economy running. second, we have launched a housing plan that will help responsible families facing the threat of foreclosure lower their monthly payments and re-finance their mortgages. it\\'s a plan that won\\'t help speculators or that neighbor down the street who bought a house he could never hope to afford, but it will help millions of americans who are struggling with declining home values - americans who will now be able to take advantage of the lower interest rates that this plan has already helped bring about. in fact, the average family who re-finances today can save nearly $2000 per year on their mortgage. third, we will act with the full force of the federal government to ensure that the major banks that americans depend on have enough confidence and enough money to lend even in more difficult times. and when we learn that a major bank has serious problems, we will hold accountable those responsible, force the necessary adjustments, provide the support to clean up their balance sheets, and assure the continuity of a strong, viable institution that can serve our people and our economy. i understand that on any given day, wall street may be more comforted by an approach that gives banks bailouts with no strings attached, and that holds nobody accountable for their reckless decisions. but such an approach won\\'t solve the problem. and our goal is to quicken the day when we re-start lending to the american people and american business and end this crisis once and for all.i intend to hold these banks fully accountable for the assistance they receive, and this time, they will have to clearly demonstrate how taxpayer dollars result in more lending for the american taxpayer. this time, ceos won\\'t be able to use taxpayer money to pad their paychecks or buy fancy drapes or disappear on a private jet. those days are over. still, this plan will require significant resources from the federal government — and yes, probably more than we\\'ve already set aside. but while the cost of action will be great, i can assure you that the cost of inaction will be far greater, for it could result in an economy that sputters along for not months or years, but perhaps a decade. that would be worse for our deficit, worse for business, worse for you, and worse for the next generation. and i refuse to let that happen. i understand that when the last administration asked this congress to provide assistance for struggling banks, democrats and republicans alike were infuriated by the mismanagement and results that followed. so were the american taxpayers. so was i. so i know how unpopular it is to be seen as helping banks right now, especially when everyone is suffering in part from their bad decisions. i promise you - i get it. but i also know that in a time of crisis, we cannot afford to govern out of anger, or yield to the politics of the moment. my job — our job — is to solve the problem. our job is to govern with a sense of responsibility. i will not spend a single penny for the purpose of rewarding a single wall street executive, but i will do whatever it takes to help the small business that can\\'t pay its workers or the family that has saved and still can\\'t get a mortgage. that\\'s what this is about. it\\'s not about helping banks — it\\'s about helping people. because when credit is available again, that young family can finally buy a new home. and then some company will hire workers to build it. and then those workers will have money to spend, and if they can get a loan too, maybe they\\'ll finally buy that car, or open their own business. investors will return to the market, and american families will see their retirement secured once more. slowly, but surely, confidence will return, and our economy will recover. so i ask this congress to join me in doing whatever proves necessary. because we cannot consign our nation to an open-ended recession. and to ensure that a crisis of this magnitude never happens again, i ask congress to move quickly on legislation that will finally reform our outdated regulatory system. it is time to put in place tough, new common-sense rules of the road so that our financial market rewards drive and innovation, and punishes short-cuts and abuse. the recovery plan and the financial stability plan are the immediate steps we\\'re taking to revive our economy in the short-term. but the only way to fully restore america\\'s economic strength is to make the long-term investments that will lead to new jobs, new industries, and a renewed ability to compete with the rest of the world. the only way this century will be another american century is if we confront at last the price of our dependence on oil and the high cost of health care; the schools that aren\\'t preparing our children and the mountain of debt they stand to inherit. that is our responsibility. in the next few days, i will submit a budget to congress. so often, we have come to view these documents as simply numbers on a page or laundry lists of programs. i see this document differently. i see it as a vision for america — as a blueprint for our future.my budget does not attempt to solve every problem or address every issue. it reflects the stark reality of what we\\'ve inherited — a trillion dollar deficit, a financial crisis, and a costly recession. given these realities, everyone in this chamber - democrats and republicans — will have to sacrifice some worthy priorities for which there are no dollars. and that includes me. but that does not mean we can afford to ignore our long-term challenges. i reject the view that says our problems will simply take care of themselves; that says government has no role in laying the foundation for our common prosperity.for history tells a different story. history reminds us that at every moment of economic upheaval and transformation, this nation has responded with bold action and big ideas. in the midst of civil war, we laid railroad tracks from one coast to another that spurred commerce and industry. from the turmoil of the industrial revolution came a system of public high schools that prepared our citizens for a new age. in the wake of war and depression, the gi bill sent a generation to college and created the largest middle-class in history. and a twilight struggle for freedom led to a nation of highways, an american on the moon, and an explosion of technology that still shapes our world. in each case, government didn\\'t supplant private enterprise; it catalyzed private enterprise. it created the conditions for thousands of entrepreneurs and new businesses to adapt and to thrive. we are a nation that has seen promise amid peril, and claimed opportunity from ordeal. now we must be that nation again. that is why, even as it cuts back on the programs we don\\'t need, the budget i submit will invest in the three areas that are absolutely critical to our economic future: energy, health care, and education. it begins with energy. we know the country that harnesses the power of clean, renewable energy will lead the 21st century. and yet, it is china that has launched the largest effort in history to make their economy energy efficient. we invented solar technology, but we\\'ve fallen behind countries like germany and japan in producing it. new plug-in hybrids roll off our assembly lines, but they will run on batteries made in korea. well i do not accept a future where the jobs and industries of tomorrow take root beyond our borders - and i know you don\\'t either. it is time for america to lead again. thanks to our recovery plan, we will double this nation\\'s supply of renewable energy in the next three years. we have also made the largest investment in basic research funding in american history - an investment that will spur not only new discoveries in energy, but breakthroughs in medicine, science, and technology. we will soon lay down thousands of miles of power lines that can carry new energy to cities and towns across this country. and we will put americans to work making our homes and buildings more efficient so that we can save billions of dollars on our energy bills. but to truly transform our economy, protect our security, and save our planet from the ravages of climate change, we need to ultimately make clean, renewable energy the profitable kind of energy. so i ask this congress to send me legislation that places a market-based cap on carbon pollution and drives the production of more renewable energy in america. and to support that innovation, we will invest fifteen billion dollars a year to develop technologies like wind power and solar power; advanced biofuels, clean coal, and more fuel-efficient cars and trucks built right here in america. as for our auto industry, everyone recognizes that years of bad decision-making and a global recession have pushed our automakers to the brink. we should not, and will not, protect them from their own bad practices. but we are committed to the goal of a re-tooled, re-imagined auto industry that can compete and win. millions of jobs depend on it. scores of communities depend on it. and i believe the nation that invented the automobile cannot walk away from it. none of this will come without cost, nor will it be easy. but this is america. we don\\'t do what\\'s easy. we do what is necessary to move this country forward. for that same reason, we must also address the crushing cost of health care. this is a cost that now causes a bankruptcy in america every thirty seconds. by the end of the year, it could cause 1.5 million americans to lose their homes. in the last eight years, premiums have grown four times faster than wages. and in each of these years, one million more americans have lost their health insurance. it is one of the major reasons why small businesses close their doors and corporations ship jobs overseas. and it\\'s one of the largest and fastest-growing parts of our budget. given these facts, we can no longer afford to put health care reform on hold. already, we have done more to advance the cause of health care reform in the last thirty days than we have in the last decade. when it was days old, this congress passed a law to provide and protect health insurance for eleven million american children whose parents work full-time. our recovery plan will invest in electronic health records and new technology that will reduce errors, bring down costs, ensure privacy, and save lives. it will launch a new effort to conquer a disease that has touched the life of nearly every american by seeking a cure for cancer in our time. and it makes the largest investment ever in preventive care, because that is one of the best ways to keep our people healthy and our costs under control. this budget builds on these reforms. it includes an historic commitment to comprehensive health care reform — a down-payment on the principle that we must have quality, affordable health care for every american. it\\'s a commitment that\\'s paid for in part by efficiencies in our system that are long overdue. and it\\'s a step we must take if we hope to bring down our deficit in the years to come. now, there will be many different opinions and ideas about how to achieve reform, and that is why i\\'m bringing together businesses and workers, doctors and health care providers, democrats and republicans to begin work on this issue next week. i suffer no illusions that this will be an easy process. it will be hard. but i also know that nearly a century after teddy roosevelt first called for reform, the cost of our health care has weighed down our economy and the conscience of our nation long enough. so let there be no doubt: health care reform cannot wait, it must not wait, and it will not wait another year. the third challenge we must address is the urgent need to expand the promise of education in america. in a global economy where the most valuable skill you can sell is your knowledge, a good education is no longer just a pathway to opportunity — it is a pre-requisite. right now, three-quarters of the fastest-growing occupations require more than a high school diploma. and yet, just over half of our citizens have that level of education. we have one of the highest high school dropout rates of any industrialized nation. and half of the students who begin college never finish. this is a prescription for economic decline, because we know the countries that out-teach us today will out-compete us tomorrow. that is why it will be the goal of this administration to ensure that every child has access to a complete and competitive education — from the day they are born to the day they begin a career. already, we have made an historic investment in education through the economic recovery plan. we have dramatically expanded early childhood education and will continue to improve its quality, because we know that the most formative learning comes in those first years of life. we have made college affordable for nearly seven million more students. and we have provided the resources necessary to prevent painful cuts and teacher layoffs that would set back our children\\'s progress. but we know that our schools don\\'t just need more resources. they need more reform. that is why this budget creates new incentives for teacher performance; pathways for advancement, and rewards for success. we\\'ll invest in innovative programs that are already helping schools meet high standards and close achievement gaps. and we will expand our commitment to charter schools. it is our responsibility as lawmakers and educators to make this system work. but it is the responsibility of every citizen to participate in it. and so tonight, i ask every american to commit to at least one year or more of higher education or career training. this can be community college or a four-year school; vocational training or an apprenticeship. but whatever the training may be, every american will need to get more than a high school diploma. and dropping out of high school is no longer an option. it\\'s not just quitting on yourself, it\\'s quitting on your country — and this country needs and values the talents of every american. that is why we will provide the support necessary for you to complete college and meet a new goal: by 2020, america will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world. i know that the price of tuition is higher than ever, which is why if you are willing to volunteer in your neighborhood or give back to your community or serve your country, we will make sure that you can afford a higher education. and to encourage a renewed spirit of national service for this and future generations, i ask this congress to send me the bipartisan legislation that bears the name of senator orrin hatch as well as an american who has never stopped asking what he can do for his country — senator edward kennedy. these education policies will open the doors of opportunity for our children. but it is up to us to ensure they walk through them. in the end, there is no program or policy that can substitute for a mother or father who will attend those parent/teacher conferences, or help with homework after dinner, or turn off the tv, put away the video games, and read to their child. i speak to you not just as a president, but as a father when i say that responsibility for our children\\'s education must begin at home. there is, of course, another responsibility we have to our children. and that is the responsibility to ensure that we do not pass on to them a debt they cannot pay. with the deficit we inherited, the cost of the crisis we face, and the long-term challenges we must meet, it has never been more important to ensure that as our economy recovers, we do what it takes to bring this deficit down. i\\'m proud that we passed the recovery plan free of earmarks, and i want to pass a budget next year that ensures that each dollar we spend reflects only our most important national priorities. yesterday, i held a fiscal summit where i pledged to cut the deficit in half by the end of my first term in office. my administration has also begun to go line by line through the federal budget in order to eliminate wasteful and ineffective programs. as you can imagine, this is a process that will take some time. but we\\'re starting with the biggest lines. we have already identified two trillion dollars in savings over the next decade. in this budget, we will end education programs that don\\'t work and end direct payments to large agribusinesses that don\\'t need them. we\\'ll eliminate the no-bid contracts that have wasted billions in iraq, and reform our defense budget so that we\\'re not paying for cold war-era weapons systems we don\\'t use. we will root out the waste, fraud, and abuse in our medicare program that doesn\\'t make our seniors any healthier, and we will restore a sense of fairness and balance to our tax code by finally ending the tax breaks for corporations that ship our jobs overseas. in order to save our children from a future of debt, we will also end the tax breaks for the wealthiest 2% of americans. but let me perfectly clear, because i know you\\'ll hear the same old claims that rolling back these tax breaks means a massive tax increase on the american people: if your family earns less than $250,000 a year, you will not see your taxes increased a single dime. i repeat: not one single dime. in fact, the recovery plan provides a tax cut — that\\'s right, a tax cut — for 95% of working families. and these checks are on the way. to preserve our long-term fiscal health, we must also address the growing costs in medicare and social security. comprehensive health care reform is the best way to strengthen medicare for years to come. and we must also begin a conversation on how to do the same for social security, while creating tax-free universal savings accounts for all americans.finally, because we\\'re also suffering from a deficit of trust, i am committed to restoring a sense of honesty and accountability to our budget. that is why this budget looks ahead ten years and accounts for spending that was left out under the old rules - and for the first time, that includes the full cost of fighting in iraq and afghanistan. for seven years, we have been a nation at war. no longer will we hide its price.we are now carefully reviewing our policies in both wars, and i will soon announce a way forward in iraq that leaves iraq to its people and responsibly ends this war. and with our friends and allies, we will forge a new and comprehensive strategy for afghanistan and pakistan to defeat al qaeda and combat extremism. because i will not allow terrorists to plot against the american people from safe havens half a world away. as we meet here tonight, our men and women in uniform stand watch abroad and more are readying to deploy. to each and every one of them, and to the families who bear the quiet burden of their absence, americans are united in sending one message: we honor your service, we are inspired by your sacrifice, and you have our unyielding support. to relieve the strain on our forces, my budget increases the number of our soldiers and marines. and to keep our sacred trust with those who serve, we will raise their pay, and give our veterans the expanded health care and benefits that they have earned. to overcome extremism, we must also be vigilant in upholding the values our troops defend — because there is no force in the world more powerful than the example of america. that is why i have ordered the closing of the detention center at guantanamo bay, and will seek swift and certain justice for captured terrorists - because living our values doesn\\'t make us weaker, it makes us safer and it makes us stronger. and that is why i can stand here tonight and say without exception or equivocation that the united states of america does not torture. in words and deeds, we are showing the world that a new era of engagement has begun. for we know that america cannot meet the threats of this century alone, but the world cannot meet them without america. we cannot shun the negotiating table, nor ignore the foes or forces that could do us harm. we are instead called to move forward with the sense of confidence and candor that serious times demand. to seek progress toward a secure and lasting peace between israel and her neighbors, we have appointed an envoy to sustain our effort. to meet the challenges of the 21st century - from terrorism to nuclear proliferation; from pandemic disease to cyber threats to crushing poverty — we will strengthen old alliances, forge new ones, and use all elements of our national power. and to respond to an economic crisis that is global in scope, we are working with the nations of the g-20 to restore confidence in our financial system, avoid the possibility of escalating protectionism, and spur demand for american goods in markets across the globe. for the world depends on us to have a strong economy, just as our economy depends on the strength of the world\\'s. as we stand at this crossroads of history, the eyes of all people in all nations are once again upon us - watching to see what we do with this moment; waiting for us to lead. those of us gathered here tonight have been called to govern in extraordinary times. it is a tremendous burden, but also a great privilege - one that has been entrusted to few generations of americans. for in our hands lies the ability to shape our world for good or for ill. i know that it is easy to lose sight of this truth — to become cynical and doubtful; consumed with the petty and the trivial. but in my life, i have also learned that hope is found in unlikely places; that inspiration often comes not from those with the most power or celebrity, but from the dreams and aspirations of americans who are anything but ordinary. i think about leonard abess, the bank president from miami who reportedly cashed out of his company, took a $60 million bonus, and gave it out to all 399 people who worked for him, plus another 72 who used to work for him. he didn\\'t tell anyone, but when the local newspaper found out, he simply said, i knew some of these people since i was 7 years old. i didn\\'t feel right getting the money myself.\"i think about greensburg, kansas, a town that was completely destroyed by a tornado, but is being rebuilt by its residents as a global example of how clean energy can power an entire community - how it can bring jobs and businesses to a place where piles of bricks and rubble once lay. \"the tragedy was terrible,\" said one of the men who helped them rebuild. \"but the folks here know that it also provided an incredible opportunity.\" and i think about ty\\'sheoma bethea, the young girl from that school i visited in dillon, south carolina — a place where the ceilings leak, the paint peels off the walls, and they have to stop teaching six times a day because the train barrels by their classroom. she has been told that her school is hopeless, but the other day after class she went to the public library and typed up a letter to the people sitting in this room. she even asked her principal for the money to buy a stamp. the letter asks us for help, and says, \"we are just students trying to become lawyers, doctors, congressmen like yourself and one day president, so we can make a change to not just the state of south carolina but also the world. we are not quitters.\" we are not quitters. these words and these stories tell us something about the spirit of the people who sent us here. they tell us that even in the most trying times, amid the most difficult circumstances, there is a generosity, a resilience, a decency, and a determination that perseveres; a willingness to take responsibility for our future and for posterity. their resolve must be our inspiration. their concerns must be our cause. and we must show them and all our people that we are equal to the task before us. i know that we haven\\'t agreed on every issue thus far, and there are surely times in the future when we will part ways. but i also know that every american who is sitting here tonight loves this country and wants it to succeed. that must be the starting point for every debate we have in the coming months, and where we return after those debates are done. that is the foundation on which the american people expect us to build common ground. and if we do — if we come together and lift this nation from the depths of this crisis; if we put our people back to work and restart the engine of our prosperity; if we confront without fear the challenges of our time and summon that enduring spirit of an america that does not quit, then someday years from now our children can tell their children that this was the time when we performed, in the words that are carved into this very chamber, \"something worthy to be remembered.\"thank you, god bless you, and may god bless the united states of america.'\n",
      " 'madam speaker, vice president biden, members of congress, distinguished guests, and fellow americans:our constitution declares that from time to time, the president shall give to congress information about the state of our union.  for 220 years, our leaders have fulfilled this duty. they\\'ve done so during periods of prosperity and tranquility.  and they\\'ve done so in the midst of war and depression; at moments of great strife and great struggle.it\\'s tempting to look back on these moments and assume that our progress was inevitable -– that america was always destined to succeed.  but when the union was turned back at bull run, and the allies first landed at omaha beach, victory was very much in doubt.  when the market crashed on black tuesday, and civil rights marchers were beaten on bloody sunday, the future was anything but certain.  these were the times that tested the courage of our convictions, and the strength of our union.  and despite all our divisions and disagreements, our hesitations and our fears, america prevailed because we chose to move forward as one nation, as one people. again, we are tested.  and again, we must answer history\\'s call.one year ago, i took office amid two wars, an economy rocked by a severe recession, a financial system on the verge of collapse, and a government deeply in debt.  experts from across the political spectrum warned that if we did not act, we might face a second depression.  so we acted -– immediately and aggressively.  and one year later, the worst of the storm has passed.but the devastation remains.  one in 10 americans still cannot find work.  many businesses have shuttered.  home values have declined.  small towns and rural communities have been hit especially hard.  and for those who\\'d already known poverty, life has become that much harder.this recession has also compounded the burdens that america\\'s families have been dealing with for decades –- the burden of working harder and longer for less; of being unable to save enough to retire or help kids with college. so i know the anxieties that are out there right now.  they\\'re not new.  these struggles are the reason i ran for president.  these struggles are what i\\'ve witnessed for years in places like elkhart, indiana; galesburg, illinois.  i hear about them in the letters that i read each night.  the toughest to read are those written by children -– asking why they have to move from their home, asking when their mom or dad will be able to go back to work.for these americans and so many others, change has not come fast enough.  some are frustrated; some are angry.  they don\\'t understand why it seems like bad behavior on wall street is rewarded, but hard work on main street isn\\'t; or why washington has been unable or unwilling to solve any of our problems.  they\\'re tired of the partisanship and the shouting and the pettiness.  they know we can\\'t afford it.  not now.  so we face big and difficult challenges.  and what the american people hope -– what they deserve -– is for all of us, democrats and republicans, to work through our differences; to overcome the numbing weight of our politics.  for while the people who sent us here have different backgrounds, different stories, different beliefs, the anxieties they face are the same. the aspirations they hold are shared:  a job that pays the bills; a chance to get ahead; most of all, the ability to give their children a better life. you know what else they share?  they share a stubborn resilience in the face of adversity.  after one of the most difficult years in our history, they remain busy building cars and teaching kids, starting businesses and going back to school. they\\'re coaching little league and helping their neighbors.  one woman wrote to me and said, \"we are strained but hopeful, struggling but encouraged.\" it\\'s because of this spirit -– this great decency and great strength -– that i have never been more hopeful about america\\'s future than i am tonight.  (applause.)  despite our hardships, our union is strong.  we do not give up.  we do not quit.  we do not allow fear or division to break our spirit.  in this new decade, it\\'s time the american people get a government that matches their decency; that embodies their strength.  (applause.)   and tonight, tonight i\\'d like to talk about how together we can deliver on that promise.   it begins with our economy. our most urgent task upon taking office was to shore up the same banks that helped cause this crisis.  it was not easy to do. and if there\\'s one thing that has unified democrats and republicans, and everybody in between, it\\'s that we all hated the bank bailout.  i hated it -- (applause.)  i hated it.  you hated it.  it was about as popular as a root canal.  (laughter.)  but when i ran for president, i promised i wouldn\\'t just do what was popular -– i would do what was necessary.  and if we had allowed the meltdown of the financial system, unemployment might be double what it is today.  more businesses would certainly have closed.  more homes would have surely been lost. so i supported the last administration\\'s efforts to create the financial rescue program.  and when we took that program over, we made it more transparent and more accountable.  and as a result, the markets are now stabilized, and we\\'ve recovered most of the money we spent on the banks.  (applause.)  most but not all.to recover the rest, i\\'ve proposed a fee on the biggest banks.  (applause.)  now, i know wall street isn\\'t keen on this idea.  but if these firms can afford to hand out big bonuses again, they can afford a modest fee to pay back the taxpayers who rescued them in their time of need.  (applause.)now, as we stabilized the financial system, we also took steps to get our economy growing again, save as many jobs as possible, and help americans who had become unemployed. that\\'s why we extended or increased unemployment benefits for more than 18 million americans; made health insurance 65 percent cheaper for families who get their coverage through cobra; and passed 25 different tax cuts.now, let me repeat:  we cut taxes.  we cut taxes for 95 percent of working families.  (applause.)  we cut taxes for small businesses.  we cut taxes for first-time homebuyers.  we cut taxes for parents trying to care for their children.  we cut taxes for 8 million americans paying for college.  (applause.)i thought i\\'d get some applause on that one.  (laughter and applause.)as a result, millions of americans had more to spend on gas and food and other necessities, all of which helped businesses keep more workers.  and we haven\\'t raised income taxes by a single dime on a single person.  not a single dime.  (applause.)because of the steps we took, there are about two million americans working right now who would otherwise be unemployed.  (applause.)  two hundred thousand work in construction and clean energy; 300,000 are teachers and other education workers.  tens of thousands are cops, firefighters, correctional officers, first responders.  (applause.)  and we\\'re on track to add another one and a half million jobs to this total by the end of the year.the plan that has made all of this possible, from the tax cuts to the jobs, is the recovery act.  (applause.)  that\\'s right -– the recovery act, also known as the stimulus bill.  (applause.)  economists on the left and the right say this bill has helped save jobs and avert disaster.  but you don\\'t have to take their word for it.  talk to the small business in phoenix that will triple its workforce because of the recovery act.  talk to the window manufacturer in philadelphia who said he used to be skeptical about the recovery act, until he had to add two more work shifts just because of the business it created.  talk to the single teacher raising two kids who was told by her principal in the last week of school that because of the recovery act, she wouldn\\'t be laid off after all. there are stories like this all across america.  and after two years of recession, the economy is growing again.  retirement funds have started to gain back some of their value.  businesses are beginning to invest again, and slowly some are starting to hire again.   but i realize that for every success story, there are other stories, of men and women who wake up with the anguish of not knowing where their next paycheck will come from; who send out resumes week after week and hear nothing in response.  that is why jobs must be our number-one focus in 2010, and that\\'s why i\\'m calling for a new jobs bill tonight.  (applause.)  now, the true engine of job creation in this country will always be america\\'s businesses.  (applause.)  but government can create the conditions necessary for businesses to expand and hire more workers. we should start where most new jobs do –- in small businesses, companies that begin when -- (applause) -- companies that begin when an entrepreneur -- when an entrepreneur takes a chance on a dream, or a worker decides it\\'s time she became her own boss.  through sheer grit and determination, these companies have weathered the recession and they\\'re ready to grow.  but when you talk to small businessowners in places like allentown, pennsylvania, or elyria, ohio, you find out that even though banks on wall street are lending again, they\\'re mostly lending to bigger companies.  financing remains difficult for small businessowners across the country, even those that are making a profit.so tonight, i\\'m proposing that we take $30 billion of the money wall street banks have repaid and use it to help community banks give small businesses the credit they need to stay afloat. (applause.)  i\\'m also proposing a new small business tax credit-– one that will go to over one million small businesses who hire new workers or raise wages.  (applause.)  while we\\'re at it, let\\'s also eliminate all capital gains taxes on small business investment, and provide a tax incentive for all large businesses and all small businesses to invest in new plants and equipment.  (applause.) next, we can put americans to work today building the infrastructure of tomorrow.  (applause.)  from the first railroads to the interstate highway system, our nation has always been built to compete.  there\\'s no reason europe or china should have the fastest trains, or the new factories that manufacture clean energy products.tomorrow, i\\'ll visit tampa, florida, where workers will soon break ground on a new high-speed railroad funded by the recovery act.  (applause.)  there are projects like that all across this country that will create jobs and help move our nation\\'s goods, services, and information.  (applause.) we should put more americans to work building clean energy facilities -- (applause) -- and give rebates to americans who make their homes more energy-efficient, which supports clean energy jobs.  (applause.)  and to encourage these and other businesses to stay within our borders, it is time to finally slash the tax breaks for companies that ship our jobs overseas, and give those tax breaks to companies that create jobs right here in the united states of america.  (applause.)now, the house has passed a jobs bill that includes some of these steps.  (applause.)  as the first order of business this year, i urge the senate to do the same, and i know they will.  (applause.)  they will.  (applause.)  people are out of work.  they\\'re hurting.  they need our help.  and i want a jobs bill on my desk without delay.  (applause.)but the truth is, these steps won\\'t make up for the seven million jobs that we\\'ve lost over the last two years.  the only way to move to full employment is to lay a new foundation for long-term economic growth, and finally address the problems that america\\'s families have confronted for years.  we can\\'t afford another so-called economic \"expansion\" like the one from the last decade –- what some call the \"lost decade\" -– where jobs grew more slowly than during any prior expansion; where the income of the average american household declined while the cost of health care and tuition reached record highs; where prosperity was built on a housing bubble and financial speculation. from the day i took office, i\\'ve been told that addressing our larger challenges is too ambitious; such an effort would be too contentious.  i\\'ve been told that our political system is too gridlocked, and that we should just put things on hold for a while. for those who make these claims, i have one simple question: how long should we wait?  how long should america put its future on hold?  (applause.)you see, washington has been telling us to wait for decades, even as the problems have grown worse.  meanwhile, china is not waiting to revamp its economy.  germany is not waiting.  india is not waiting.  these nations -- they\\'re not standing still.  these nations aren\\'t playing for second place.  they\\'re putting more emphasis on math and science.  they\\'re rebuilding their infrastructure.  they\\'re making serious investments in clean energy because they want those jobs.  well, i do not accept second place for the united states of america.  (applause.) as hard as it may be, as uncomfortable and contentious as the debates may become, it\\'s time to get serious about fixing the problems that are hampering our growth.now, one place to start is serious financial reform.  look, i am not interested in punishing banks.  i\\'m interested in protecting our economy.  a strong, healthy financial market makes it possible for businesses to access credit and create new jobs. it channels the savings of families into investments that raise incomes.  but that can only happen if we guard against the same recklessness that nearly brought down our entire economy. we need to make sure consumers and middle-class families have the information they need to make financial decisions.  (applause.)  we can\\'t allow financial institutions, including those that take your deposits, to take risks that threaten the whole economy.  now, the house has already passed financial reform with many of these changes.  (applause.)  and the lobbyists are trying to kill it.  but we cannot let them win this fight.  (applause.)  and if the bill that ends up on my desk does not meet the test of real reform, i will send it back until we get it right.  we\\'ve got to get it right.  (applause.)next, we need to encourage american innovation.  last year, we made the largest investment in basic research funding in history -– (applause) -- an investment that could lead to the world\\'s cheapest solar cells or treatment that kills cancer cells but leaves healthy ones untouched.  and no area is more ripe for such innovation than energy.  you can see the results of last year\\'s investments in clean energy -– in the north carolina company that will create 1,200 jobs nationwide helping to make advanced batteries; or in the california business that will put a thousand people to work making solar panels.but to create more of these clean energy jobs, we need more production, more efficiency, more incentives.  and that means building a new generation of safe, clean nuclear power plants in this country.  (applause.)  it means making tough decisions about opening new offshore areas for oil and gas development.  (applause.)  it means continued investment in advanced biofuels and clean coal technologies.  (applause.)  and, yes, it means passing a comprehensive energy and climate bill with incentives that will finally make clean energy the profitable kind of energy in america.  (applause.)i am grateful to the house for passing such a bill last year.  (applause.)  and this year i\\'m eager to help advance the bipartisan effort in the senate.  (applause.) i know there have been questions about whether we can afford such changes in a tough economy.  i know that there are those who disagree with the overwhelming scientific evidence on climate change.  but here\\'s the thing -- even if you doubt the evidence, providing incentives for energy-efficiency and clean energy are the right thing to do for our future -– because the nation that leads the clean energy economy will be the nation that leads the global economy.  and america must be that nation.  (applause.)third, we need to export more of our goods.  (applause.)  because the more products we make and sell to other countries, the more jobs we support right here in america.  (applause.)  so tonight, we set a new goal:  we will double our exports over the next five years, an increase that will support two million jobs in america.  (applause.)  to help meet this goal, we\\'re launching a national export initiative that will help farmers and small businesses increase their exports, and reform export controls consistent with national security.  (applause.)we have to seek new markets aggressively, just as our competitors are.  if america sits on the sidelines while other nations sign trade deals, we will lose the chance to create jobs on our shores.  (applause.)  but realizing those benefits also means enforcing those agreements so our trading partners play by the rules.  (applause.)  and that\\'s why we\\'ll continue to shape a doha trade agreement that opens global markets, and why we will strengthen our trade relations in asia and with key partners like south korea and panama and colombia.  (applause.)fourth, we need to invest in the skills and education of our people.  (applause.)now, this year, we\\'ve broken through the stalemate between left and right by launching a national competition to improve our schools.  and the idea here is simple:  instead of rewarding failure, we only reward success.  instead of funding the status quo, we only invest in reform -- reform that raises student achievement; inspires students to excel in math and science; and turns around failing schools that steal the future of too many young americans, from rural communities to the inner city.  in the 21st century, the best anti-poverty program around is a world-class education.  (applause.)  and in this country, the success of our children cannot depend more on where they live than on their potential. when we renew the elementary and secondary education act, we will work with congress to expand these reforms to all 50 states.  still, in this economy, a high school diploma no longer guarantees a good job.  that\\'s why i urge the senate to follow the house and pass a bill that will revitalize our community colleges, which are a career pathway to the children of so many working families.  (applause.) to make college more affordable, this bill will finally end the unwarranted taxpayer subsidies that go to banks for student loans.  (applause.)  instead, let\\'s take that money and give families a $10,000 tax credit for four years of college and increase pell grants.  (applause.)  and let\\'s tell another one million students that when they graduate, they will be required to pay only 10 percent of their income on student loans, and all of their debt will be forgiven after 20 years –- and forgiven after 10 years if they choose a career in public service, because in the united states of america, no one should go broke because they chose to go to college.  (applause.) and by the way, it\\'s time for colleges and universities to get serious about cutting their own costs -– (applause) -- because they, too, have a responsibility to help solve this problem. now, the price of college tuition is just one of the burdens facing the middle class.  that\\'s why last year i asked vice president biden to chair a task force on middle-class families.  that\\'s why we\\'re nearly doubling the child care tax credit, and making it easier to save for retirement by giving access to every worker a retirement account and expanding the tax credit for those who start a nest egg.  that\\'s why we\\'re working to lift the value of a family\\'s single largest investment –- their home.  the steps we took last year to shore up the housing market have allowed millions of americans to take out new loans and save an average of $1,500 on mortgage payments.     this year, we will step up refinancing so that homeowners can move into more affordable mortgages.  (applause.)  and it is precisely to relieve the burden on middle-class families that we still need health insurance reform.  (applause.)  yes, we do.  (applause.)now, let\\'s clear a few things up.  (laughter.)  i didn\\'t choose to tackle this issue to get some legislative victory under my belt.  and by now it should be fairly obvious that i didn\\'t take on health care because it was good politics.  (laughter.)  i took on health care because of the stories i\\'ve heard from americans with preexisting conditions whose lives depend on getting coverage; patients who\\'ve been denied coverage; families –- even those with insurance -– who are just one illness away from financial ruin.after nearly a century of trying -- democratic administrations, republican administrations -- we are closer than ever to bringing more security to the lives of so many americans.  the approach we\\'ve taken would protect every american from the worst practices of the insurance industry.  it would give small businesses and uninsured americans a chance to choose an affordable health care plan in a competitive market.  it would require every insurance plan to cover preventive care. and by the way, i want to acknowledge our first lady, michelle obama, who this year is creating a national movement to tackle the epidemic of childhood obesity and make kids healthier. (applause.)  thank you.  she gets embarrassed.  (laughter.)our approach would preserve the right of americans who have insurance to keep their doctor and their plan.  it would reduce costs and premiums for millions of families and businesses.  and according to the congressional budget office -– the independent organization that both parties have cited as the official scorekeeper for congress –- our approach would bring down the deficit by as much as $1 trillion over the next two decades.  (applause.)still, this is a complex issue, and the longer it was debated, the more skeptical people became.  i take my share of the blame for not explaining it more clearly to the american people.  and i know that with all the lobbying and horse-trading, the process left most americans wondering, \"what\\'s in it for me?\"but i also know this problem is not going away.  by the time i\\'m finished speaking tonight, more americans will have lost their health insurance.  millions will lose it this year.  our deficit will grow.  premiums will go up.  patients will be denied the care they need.  small business owners will continue to drop coverage altogether.  i will not walk away from these americans, and neither should the people in this chamber.  (applause.)so, as temperatures cool, i want everyone to take another look at the plan we\\'ve proposed.  there\\'s a reason why many doctors, nurses, and health care experts who know our system best consider this approach a vast improvement over the status quo.  but if anyone from either party has a better approach that will bring down premiums, bring down the deficit, cover the uninsured, strengthen medicare for seniors, and stop insurance company abuses, let me know.  (applause.)  let me know.  let me know.  (applause.)  i\\'m eager to see it. here\\'s what i ask congress, though:  don\\'t walk away from reform.  not now.  not when we are so close.  let us find a way to come together and finish the job for the american people.  (applause.)  let\\'s get it done.  let\\'s get it done.  (applause.)now, even as health care reform would reduce our deficit, it\\'s not enough to dig us out of a massive fiscal hole in which we find ourselves.  it\\'s a challenge that makes all others that much harder to solve, and one that\\'s been subject to a lot of political posturing.  so let me start the discussion of government spending by setting the record straight. at the beginning of the last decade, the year 2000, america had a budget surplus of over $200 billion.  (applause.)  by the time i took office, we had a one-year deficit of over $1 trillion and projected deficits of $8 trillion over the next decade.  most of this was the result of not paying for two wars, two tax cuts, and an expensive prescription drug program.  on top of that, the effects of the recession put a $3 trillion hole in our budget.  all this was before i walked in the door.  (laughter and applause.)now -- just stating the facts.  now, if we had taken office in ordinary times, i would have liked nothing more than to start bringing down the deficit.  but we took office amid a crisis.  and our efforts to prevent a second depression have added another $1 trillion to our national debt.  that, too, is a fact.i\\'m absolutely convinced that was the right thing to do.  but families across the country are tightening their belts and making tough decisions.  the federal government should do the same.  (applause.)  so tonight, i\\'m proposing specific steps to pay for the trillion dollars that it took to rescue the economy last year.starting in 2011, we are prepared to freeze government spending for three years.  (applause.)  spending related to our national security, medicare, medicaid, and social security will not be affected.  but all other discretionary government programs will.  like any cash-strapped family, we will work within a budget to invest in what we need and sacrifice what we don\\'t.  and if i have to enforce this discipline by veto, i will.  (applause.)  we will continue to go through the budget, line by line, page by page, to eliminate programs that we can\\'t afford and don\\'t work.  we\\'ve already identified $20 billion in savings for next year.  to help working families, we\\'ll extend our middle-class tax cuts.  but at a time of record deficits, we will not continue tax cuts for oil companies, for investment fund managers, and for those making over $250,000 a year.  we just can\\'t afford it.  (applause.) now, even after paying for what we spent on my watch, we\\'ll still face the massive deficit we had when i took office.  more importantly, the cost of medicare, medicaid, and social security will continue to skyrocket.  that\\'s why i\\'ve called for a bipartisan fiscal commission, modeled on a proposal by republican judd gregg and democrat kent conrad.  (applause.)  this can\\'t be one of those washington gimmicks that lets us pretend we solved a problem.  the commission will have to provide a specific set of solutions by a certain deadline. now, yesterday, the senate blocked a bill that would have created this commission.  so i\\'ll issue an executive order that will allow us to go forward, because i refuse to pass this problem on to another generation of americans.  (applause.)  and when the vote comes tomorrow, the senate should restore the pay-as-you-go law that was a big reason for why we had record surpluses in the 1990s.  (applause.) now, i know that some in my own party will argue that we can\\'t address the deficit or freeze government spending when so many are still hurting.  and i agree -- which is why this freeze won\\'t take effect until next year -- (laughter) -- when the economy is stronger.  that\\'s how budgeting works.  (laughter and applause.)  but understand –- understand if we don\\'t take meaningful steps to rein in our debt, it could damage our markets, increase the cost of borrowing, and jeopardize our recovery -– all of which would have an even worse effect on our job growth and family incomes. from some on the right, i expect we\\'ll hear a different argument -– that if we just make fewer investments in our people, extend tax cuts including those for the wealthier americans, eliminate more regulations, maintain the status quo on health care, our deficits will go away.  the problem is that\\'s what we did for eight years.  (applause.)  that\\'s what helped us into this crisis.  it\\'s what helped lead to these deficits.  we can\\'t do it again.rather than fight the same tired battles that have dominated washington for decades, it\\'s time to try something new.  let\\'s invest in our people without leaving them a mountain of debt.  let\\'s meet our responsibility to the citizens who sent us here.  let\\'s try common sense.  (laughter.)  a novel concept.to do that, we have to recognize that we face more than a deficit of dollars right now.  we face a deficit of trust -– deep and corrosive doubts about how washington works that have been growing for years.  to close that credibility gap we have to take action on both ends of pennsylvania avenue -- to end the outsized influence of lobbyists; to do our work openly; to give our people the government they deserve.  (applause.)that\\'s what i came to washington to do.  that\\'s why -– for the first time in history –- my administration posts on our white house visitors online.  that\\'s why we\\'ve excluded lobbyists from policymaking jobs, or seats on federal boards and commissions.but we can\\'t stop there.  it\\'s time to require lobbyists to disclose each contact they make on behalf of a client with my administration or with congress.  it\\'s time to put strict limits on the contributions that lobbyists give to candidates for federal office. with all due deference to separation of powers, last week the supreme court reversed a century of law that i believe will open the floodgates for special interests –- including foreign corporations –- to spend without limit in our elections.  (applause.)  i don\\'t think american elections should be bankrolled by america\\'s most powerful interests, or worse, by foreign entities.  (applause.)  they should be decided by the american people.  and i\\'d urge democrats and republicans to pass a bill that helps to correct some of these problems.i\\'m also calling on congress to continue down the path of earmark reform.  (applause.)  democrats and republicans.  (applause.)  democrats and republicans.  you\\'ve trimmed some of this spending, you\\'ve embraced some meaningful change.  but restoring the public trust demands more.  for example, some members of congress post some earmark requests online.  (applause.)  tonight, i\\'m calling on congress to publish all earmark requests on a single web site before there\\'s a vote, so that the american people can see how their money is being spent. (applause.)of course, none of these reforms will even happen if we don\\'t also reform how we work with one another.  now, i\\'m not naïve.  i never thought that the mere fact of my election would usher in peace and harmony -- (laughter) -- and some post-partisan era.  i knew that both parties have fed divisions that are deeply entrenched.  and on some issues, there are simply philosophical differences that will always cause us to part ways. these disagreements, about the role of government in our lives, about our national priorities and our national security, they\\'ve been taking place for over 200 years.  they\\'re the very essence of our democracy.but what frustrates the american people is a washington where every day is election day.  we can\\'t wage a perpetual campaign where the only goal is to see who can get the most embarrassing headlines about the other side -– a belief that if you lose, i win.  neither party should delay or obstruct every single bill just because they can.  the confirmation of -- (applause) -- i\\'m speaking to both parties now.  the confirmation of well-qualified public servants shouldn\\'t be held hostage to the pet projects or grudges of a few individual senators.  (applause.) washington may think that saying anything about the other side, no matter how false, no matter how malicious, is just part of the game.  but it\\'s precisely such politics that has stopped either party from helping the american people.  worse yet, it\\'s sowing further division among our citizens, further distrust in our government.so, no, i will not give up on trying to change the tone of our politics.  i know it\\'s an election year.  and after last week, it\\'s clear that campaign fever has come even earlier than usual.  but we still need to govern. to democrats, i would remind you that we still have the largest majority in decades, and the people expect us to solve problems, not run for the hills.  (applause.)  and if the republican leadership is going to insist that 60 votes in the senate are required to do any business at all in this town -- a supermajority -- then the responsibility to govern is now yours as well.  (applause.)  just saying no to everything may be good short-term politics, but it\\'s not leadership.  we were sent here to serve our citizens, not our ambitions.  (applause.)  so let\\'s show the american people that we can do it together.  (applause.)this week, i\\'ll be addressing a meeting of the house republicans.  i\\'d like to begin monthly meetings with both democratic and republican leadership.  i know you can\\'t wait.  (laughter.)throughout our history, no issue has united this country more than our security.  sadly, some of the unity we felt after 9/11 has dissipated.  we can argue all we want about who\\'s to blame for this, but i\\'m not interested in re-litigating the past. i know that all of us love this country.  all of us are committed to its defense.  so let\\'s put aside the schoolyard taunts about who\\'s tough.  let\\'s reject the false choice between protecting our people and upholding our values.  let\\'s leave behind the fear and division, and do what it takes to defend our nation and forge a more hopeful future -- for america and for the world.  (applause.)that\\'s the work we began last year.  since the day i took office, we\\'ve renewed our focus on the terrorists who threaten our nation.  we\\'ve made substantial investments in our homeland security and disrupted plots that threatened to take american lives.  we are filling unacceptable gaps revealed by the failed christmas attack, with better airline security and swifter action on our intelligence.  we\\'ve prohibited torture and strengthened partnerships from the pacific to south asia to the arabian peninsula.  and in the last year, hundreds of al qaeda\\'s fighters and affiliates, including many senior leaders, have been captured or killed -- far more than in 2008.and in afghanistan, we\\'re increasing our troops and training afghan security forces so they can begin to take the lead in july of 2011, and our troops can begin to come home.  (applause.)  we will reward good governance, work to reduce corruption, and support the rights of all afghans -- men and women alike.  (applause.)  we\\'re joined by allies and partners who have increased their own commitments, and who will come together tomorrow in london to reaffirm our common purpose.  there will be difficult days ahead.  but i am absolutely confident we will succeed.as we take the fight to al qaeda, we are responsibly leaving iraq to its people.  as a candidate, i promised that i would end this war, and that is what i am doing as president.  we will have all of our combat troops out of iraq by the end of this august.  (applause.)  we will support the iraqi government -- we will support the iraqi government as they hold elections, and we will continue to partner with the iraqi people to promote regional peace and prosperity.  but make no mistake:  this war is ending, and all of our troops are coming home.  (applause.)   tonight, all of our men and women in uniform -- in iraq, in afghanistan, and around the world –- they have to know that we -- that they have our respect, our gratitude, our full support.  and just as they must have the resources they need in war, we all have a responsibility to support them when they come home.  (applause.)  that\\'s why we made the largest increase in investments for veterans in decades -- last year.  (applause.)   that\\'s why we\\'re building a 21st century va.  and that\\'s why michelle has joined with jill biden to forge a national commitment to support military families.  (applause.)now, even as we prosecute two wars, we\\'re also confronting perhaps the greatest danger to the american people -– the threat of nuclear weapons.  i\\'ve embraced the vision of john f. kennedy and ronald reagan through a strategy that reverses the spread of these weapons and seeks a world without them.  to reduce our stockpiles and launchers, while ensuring our deterrent, the united states and russia are completing negotiations on the farthest-reaching arms control treaty in nearly two decades.  (applause.)  and at april\\'s nuclear security summit, we will bring 44 nations together here in washington, d.c. behind a clear goal:  securing all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world in four years, so that they never fall into the hands of terrorists.  (applause.)now, these diplomatic efforts have also strengthened our hand in dealing with those nations that insist on violating international agreements in pursuit of nuclear weapons.  that\\'s why north korea now faces increased isolation, and stronger sanctions –- sanctions that are being vigorously enforced.  that\\'s why the international community is more united, and the islamic republic of iran is more isolated.  and as iran\\'s leaders continue to ignore their obligations, there should be no doubt:  they, too, will face growing consequences.  that is a promise.  (applause.)that\\'s the leadership that we are providing –- engagement that advances the common security and prosperity of all people. we\\'re working through the g20 to sustain a lasting global recovery.  we\\'re working with muslim communities around the world to promote science and education and innovation.  we have gone from a bystander to a leader in the fight against climate change. we\\'re helping developing countries to feed themselves, and continuing the fight against hiv/aids.  and we are launching a new initiative that will give us the capacity to respond faster and more effectively to bioterrorism or an infectious disease -– a plan that will counter threats at home and strengthen public health abroad.as we have for over 60 years, america takes these actions because our destiny is connected to those beyond our shores.  but we also do it because it is right.  that\\'s why, as we meet here tonight, over 10,000 americans are working with many nations to help the people of haiti recover and rebuild.  (applause.)  that\\'s why we stand with the girl who yearns to go to school in afghanistan; why we support the human rights of the women marching through the streets of iran; why we advocate for the young man denied a job by corruption in guinea.  for america must always stand on the side of freedom and human dignity.  (applause.)  always.  (applause.)abroad, america\\'s greatest source of strength has always been our ideals.  the same is true at home.  we find unity in our incredible diversity, drawing on the promise enshrined in our constitution:  the notion that we\\'re all created equal; that no matter who you are or what you look like, if you abide by the law you should be protected by it; if you adhere to our common values you should be treated no different than anyone else.    we must continually renew this promise.  my administration has a civil rights division that is once again prosecuting civil rights violations and employment discrimination.  (applause.)  we finally strengthened our laws to protect against crimes driven by hate.  (applause.)  this year, i will work with congress and our military to finally repeal the law that denies gay americans the right to serve the country they love because of who they are.  (applause.)  it\\'s the right thing to do.  (applause.)  we\\'re going to crack down on violations of equal pay laws -– so that women get equal pay for an equal day\\'s work.  (applause.) and we should continue the work of fixing our broken immigration system -– to secure our borders and enforce our laws, and ensure that everyone who plays by the rules can contribute to our economy and enrich our nation.  (applause.)in the end, it\\'s our ideals, our values that built america  -- values that allowed us to forge a nation made up of immigrants from every corner of the globe; values that drive our citizens still.  every day, americans meet their responsibilities to their families and their employers.  time and again, they lend a hand to their neighbors and give back to their country.  they take pride in their labor, and are generous in spirit.  these aren\\'t republican values or democratic values that they\\'re living by; business values or labor values.  they\\'re american values.  unfortunately, too many of our citizens have lost faith that our biggest institutions -– our corporations, our media, and, yes, our government –- still reflect these same values.  each of these institutions are full of honorable men and women doing important work that helps our country prosper.  but each time a ceo rewards himself for failure, or a banker puts the rest of us at risk for his own selfish gain, people\\'s doubts grow.  each time lobbyists game the system or politicians tear each other down instead of lifting this country up, we lose faith.  the more that tv pundits reduce serious debates to silly arguments, big issues into sound bites, our citizens turn away.  no wonder there\\'s so much cynicism out there.  no wonder there\\'s so much disappointment. i campaigned on the promise of change –- change we can believe in, the slogan went.  and right now, i know there are many americans who aren\\'t sure if they still believe we can change –- or that i can deliver it. but remember this –- i never suggested that change would be easy, or that i could do it alone.  democracy in a nation of 300 million people can be noisy and messy and complicated.  and when you try to do big things and make big changes, it stirs passions and controversy.  that\\'s just how it is.those of us in public office can respond to this reality by playing it safe and avoid telling hard truths and pointing fingers.  we can do what\\'s necessary to keep our poll numbers high, and get through the next election instead of doing what\\'s best for the next generation. but i also know this:  if people had made that decision 50 years ago, or 100 years ago, or 200 years ago, we wouldn\\'t be here tonight.  the only reason we are here is because generations of americans were unafraid to do what was hard; to do what was needed even when success was uncertain; to do what it took to keep the dream of this nation alive for their children and their grandchildren.our administration has had some political setbacks this year, and some of them were deserved.  but i wake up every day knowing that they are nothing compared to the setbacks that families all across this country have faced this year.  and what keeps me going -– what keeps me fighting -– is that despite all these setbacks, that spirit of determination and optimism, that fundamental decency that has always been at the core of the american people, that lives on.   it lives on in the struggling small business owner who wrote to me of his company, \"none of us,\" he said, \"…are willing to consider, even slightly, that we might fail.\"it lives on in the woman who said that even though she and her neighbors have felt the pain of recession, \"we are strong.  we are resilient.  we are american.\"it lives on in the 8-year-old boy in louisiana, who just sent me his allowance and asked if i would give it to the people of haiti. and it lives on in all the americans who\\'ve dropped everything to go someplace they\\'ve never been and pull people they\\'ve never known from the rubble, prompting chants of \"u.s.a.! u.s.a.!  u.s.a!\" when another life was saved. the spirit that has sustained this nation for more than two centuries lives on in you, its people.  we have finished a difficult year.  we have come through a difficult decade.  but a new year has come.  a new decade stretches before us.  we don\\'t quit.  i don\\'t quit.  (applause.)  let\\'s seize this moment -- to start anew, to carry the dream forward, and to strengthen our union once more.  (applause.)thank you.  god bless you.  and god bless the united states of america.  (applause.)']\n",
